                    TDC_ARTICLE_STARTActress Olivia Munn is set to share her social media platforms with British Columbia's provincial health officer for a day to talk about COVID-19.
Dr. Bonnie Henry will be featured primarily on Munn's Instagram account on Tuesday as part of the ONE World Campaign's #PassTheMic initiative.
The campaign is from ONE, a global movement aimed at ending extreme poverty and preventable disease by 2030.
The non-partisan ONE movement was co-founded by U2 lead vocalist Bono.
The ONE World Campaign is "demanding solidarity and collective action against COVID-19 from leaders across the planet.''

Munn is known for roles on "The Newsroom'' and "X-Men: Apocalypse.''
Dr. Bonnie Henry brings wealth of global experience to B.C.'s COVID-19 response

It is impossible for me to state that this is "the dumbest thing ever," since Globo Homo Schlomo is finding new and improved malicious stupidities everyday now, but we now have washed up celebrities giving their twatter accounts to "medical experts," as a stunning and brave attack on Coronavirus. In this particular case Olivia Munn, a girl who used to be hot ten years ago, has given her account to our Provincial Health Officer, Dr. Bonnie Henry. For the record, Dr. Henry appears to be fine and reasonably competent, and the utter catastrophe that is our provincial, federal, and global governmental response to SARS 2.0 is definitely not on her shoulders. As I've said before, dealing with pandemics requires preparation and planning ahead of time, and there is nothing that Dr. Henry or any individual can do in a press conference to rectify the incompetence of the current and previous regimes. Regardless, #PassTheMic is absurd, and let us count the ways.
Right off the bat, this is obviously a publicity stunt for a washed up former starlet, Olivia Munn. I hadn't even thought about that particular piece of ass in 5 years or more, but here she goes, back in the news. The #PassTheMic initiative was started by none other than U2 lead singer, Bono, another washed up former somebody who I had the pleasure of ignoring for the past 5 years, at minimum. Straight from the article, "Other celebrity #PassTheMic participants include actors Julia Roberts, Danai Gurira, and Hugh Jackman." Julia Roberts and Hugh Jackman are practically the archetype for "used to be huge, but aren't anymore," and I have no idea nor do I care to inform myself as to who exactly Danai Gurira is, other than some Hollywood Douche. Or maybe a genuinely great guy, you have to play the odds with this stuff. 
The non-celebrity backers are borderline parody. "Medical and policy experts who've signed on include top U.S. infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, Dr. Tsion Firew of Columbia University, and Nigeria's former finance minister, Ngozi Okonjo Iweala." Wow, Nigeria's former finance minister is on board? Sign me up. If the medical and scientific powerhouse that is Nigera has its finance minster on board, sorry, FORMER finance minister on board, like not even the guy who is the current finance minister, a different guy, the guy who used to figure out how to steal Nigerians money on behalf of the government but now doesn't do anything, that guy, if he's on board how could you possibly doubt the validity of this hot new initiative? It's almost like the CBC put that in as a subversive take, just to show what a joke these people are. 
And like with "Muh Global Wahming" you know that this is political because of how fake their solutions are. America is currently undergoing a massive Anti-White Program, combined with simultaneous black looting. Radio silence from the "wash your hands disease-spreader!" crowd. That's not to do some lightswitch brain "virus fake, me hug homeless," grug take here, but this is just pure politics, completely divorced from any sort of solutions for we the people.
