You're reminder that the Meng Wanzhou case is because Zionist Jews, or Jew Nationalists, are really assmad at China doing deals with Iran, so they, through the Canadian Federal government kidnapped Meng Wanzhou and are holding her hostage. You can read my overview <a href="../Articles/MengWanzhouArrest.html">here,</a> my detailed article on the arrest <a href="../Articles/VanMountieSuggestArrestMengWanzhou.html">here</a> and some snarky bullshit done by the propaganda <a href="../Articles/MENG_Spokesperson.html">here.</a> 

Anyway, her show trial has been progressing.

A lawyer for Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou says the case before a British Columbia Supreme Court judge is “unprecedented” in that the extradition request from the United States violates international law.

Gib van Ert told Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes on Tuesday that Canadian courts have stayed extradition proceedings because of international law breaches in the past, but in those cases the conduct around the request was unlawful.

The case against Meng is unique because the request itself is unlawful, as American authorities are seeking the Chinese national on fraud charges that have no connection to the United States, he said.

“We cannot find any such case. We don't believe that any requesting state has ever made such a request to this country,” van Ert told the judge. “You find yourself in an unusual and even unprecedented situation.”

Honestly, I could just end this article right here. This is a purely political kidnapping, and the lawyers for Meng Wanzhou are somewhat losing their shit over how illegal it is. The US has no actual legal basis through which to extradite Meng Wanzhou, but I guess it raises the interesting philosophical question of, is it illegal if it's done by the state?

Her lawyer argued the allegations have nothing to do with the United States. Meng is a Chinese national, HSBC is an English-Chinese bank and the meeting between them happened in Hong Kong.

Payments between the subsidiary and HSBC were made in American dollars and cleared through U.S. banks, but van Ert said this connection is “incidental” and not genuine or substantial.

I mean it's just so absurd. There is absolutely no possible reason the US could have for extraditing her. It's akin to the argument that all crimes that at some point involved US dollars are the jurisdiction of the US. Why stop here then? Maybe if two crack dealers in Brazil kill each other over an american $20 bill, they should get extradited to the US using the same "logic". 

The rest of the article is more of the lawyers pointing out how absurdly bullshit the entire case is, with legal minutiae. The details aren't that important. If you want a laugh, go read out the links I gave above, but if you're really impatient, I'll just print out the important bits from her arrest here once again.

If we now take a very close look at what's going on with the details of this case, we see many obvious problems.

1) RCMP officers pretended Meng Wanzhou had zero ties in Canada, despite owning two homes, and having Permanent Residency Status.

2) Someone between the RCMP and CSBA pretended that a 50 year old Asian lady, by herself, required a huge security team to arrest. This was clearly done as a show, to humiliate Meng Wanzhou, for political reasons.

3) Adding on to that, the utter absurdity of pretending they needed to go onto the plane, because this Asian Lady was really fast or something, or maybe she was going to hoodini her way off the side of the plane or something retarded, is so beyond stupid that it can only be argued in bad faith. They ultimately decided the optics were too bad, but that this was even considered shows that this was done to humiliate Meng, and the Chinese more broadly.

4) There was no reason for the CBSA investigation to happen before the RCMP investigation. Or rather, no valid reason. Instead, this was done to fish out as much information as possible, with Meng not having a lawyer.

5) Even more importantly, the CBSA had the authority to, without a warrant, confiscate materials such as Meng's laptop, phone, and phone passcodes. The RCMP does not legally have the authority to obtain those materials.

6) The CBSA then pulled the world's least believable "whoopsie," and "accidentally," gave information the RCMP would not legally be able to obtain, such as phone passcodes, to the RCMP. As well as the two phones, the laptop, and the tablet.

7) Nobody in the CBSA was disciplined in any way for this.

8) The RCMP "didn't think anything of it," when presented with materials, data and information that they would not be legally allowed to obtain.

9) The RCMP then refused to give back any of Meng's belongings, using the baffling excuse that doing so would provide a "lack of transparency," despite objectively doing the opposite. They then logged her passcodes because "they had already been siezed," despite this being illegal for the RCMP to obtain.

10) Multiple RCMP officers and CBSA officers have strenuosly denied any contact with the FBI, but we have emails of them talking with FBI agents.

And many others, which I might include in an update, although I think this serves as a good synopsis for now.

So it's laughably fake. And as far as the geopolitical ramifications...

The case has severely strained Canada-China relations. Beijing detained two Canadians, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, shortly after Meng's arrest and their one-day trials were recently held behind closed doors, though no verdicts were released.

Meng is on bail and living with her husband and children in one of her multimillion-dollar homes in Vancouver. The final phase of the B.C. Supreme Court process, an extradition hearing, is scheduled for May.

...which is precisely the point. The point is to "strain Canada-China relations," by putting pressure on China over their relief of Iran. It is yet another case of jew people using the goyim to do their dirty work. We suffer decreased relations with China and get absolutely nothing in return for this. Don't you just love fake democracy?
