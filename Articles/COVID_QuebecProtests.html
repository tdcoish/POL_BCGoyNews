Over a dozen tickets were handed out at a Montreal protest against the province-wide curfew on Saturday evening while across the province over 200 tickets were handed out to those breaking public sanitary measures.

In total, Montreal police (SPVM) said 17 tickets were handed out at the gathering, which began at 7:30 p.m. and soon violated the new curfew, which went into effect at 8 p.m.

Police stopped several protesters but a spokesperson said no arrests were made.

Alrighty goy, you take a look at me and you tell me what you think of this (((Kovac))) fellow. I wanna see a poll in the telegram chat after this, because my jewdar is off the charts. Pushing an anti-social piece with a nose like that? I'd give at least 3:1 odds.

The demonstration began on Mount Royal East, winding down several streets before SPVM officers dispersed the crowd at St-Andre and St-Gregoire.

In total, the SPVM reported 84 non-compliance incidents in a provisional report.

Oh he's gotta be a jew. 100%. I feel foolish for even questioning this. 10:1 odds goy.

The protest was one of several planned across Quebec. In Sept-Iles, the Surete du Quebec said around 20 vehicles gathered at 7:45 p.m. but were dispersed by police soon after. 

In a statement posted to social media, the group responsible for planning the gatherings called for the end of the "state of emergency," writing that they stand “against curfews and abusive measures.”

In Quebec City around 8:20 p.m., around 20 demonstrators received fines in front of the Musee de la civilization, in the Old Port. Some of them who refused to be identified were detained, said SPVQ officer Etienne Doyon.

Wait, I thought you said there were no arrests? What's the difference? Well, I looked it up and apparently the difference is that the police have to haul you off to jail for it to be an arrest. However, if they just prevent you from leaving an area while questioning you, it's detainment.

Anyway, that's not really all that important. What's important is that this fucking kike, and the other propagandists had the same message, is basically gloating at how oppressed the goyim are. As I have <a href="../Articles/PSA_CovidSolutions.html">detailed before</a> these Covid restrictions are hilariously fake. We have people who fly in forced to "hotel quarantine," people who drive in forced to "self-isolate," and truckers not forced to do anything, as one absurdity. So good on the French for having this protest, and let me go ahead and show you pictures of these protests, because this fucking kike is trying to pretend that it's just a few people here and there.

Oh wait, I'm a retard. The above article is from January 8th. I was thinking of the protests from the weekend. Okay, new article time.

MONTREAL -- Citing concerns for mental health, a large growd gathered in the streets of Quebec City on Sunday to demand the resumption of organized sports in the province.

Many participants wore their sports teams' jerseys over their coats. For many, those jerseys have been in the closet since Oct. 1, when Premier Francois Legault put organized sports on hiatus after they were temporarily resumed during the summer.

The crowd was primarily made up of young people who had been affected by the ban on engaging in their chosen sports.

Isaac Pepin, a secondary five student and football player from the Quebec City region, was the event's organizer.

“I'm really happy to see that there are so many people getting involved in the cause, asking for the revival of sports. It's really incredible,” he said.

The 16-year-old student at Seminaire St-Francois had written to Legault to remind him of the importance of sports to young people and asked for a meeting with Education Minister Isabelle Charest.

These fucking propagandists I swear to god. There are no pictures in this piece of Issac Pepin. Nor are there any pictures of the thousands of people protesting yet another arbitrary imposition of "muh COVID," on them. Unlike when there are inorganic "mostly peaceful protests," that these cretins support, such as some BLM event. So here, I've included a picture of Isaac Pepin below.

Discussions are continuing between Minister of Education Isabelle Charest and sports federations with the aim of presenting a plan for the progressive deconfinement of sports next week.

Health authorities have also authorized the resumption of extracurricular activities throughout the province as of March 15.

“I expect the government to give us concrete answers so we can start sports again in the safest possible way,” said Pepin. 

On Twitter, Charest acknowledged the protest, saying she heard “these cries from the heart.”

Keep in mind as you read this, that we have truckers being allowed to cross over the border willy nilly. <a href="../Articles/PSA_CovidSolutions.html">That's how fake our COVID "response" is</a>. We have cartoonishly stupid "COVID quarantine hotels," that people who have been to the Chinese version have said are hilariously worthless. We have <a href="../Articles/COVID_OntarioHealthOfficialRealVictim.html">film studios working with hair allowed to be open, while hairdressers must close</a>. All of this is totally fake and gay, and when some propagandist starts talking about "muh progressive deconfinement," you should chuckle at them attempting to be taken seriously.

Parti Quebecois critic for sports Meganne Perry Melancon was present for the march. She said that young people don't know when they can return to sports has had “a huge impact” on their health.

“They are more depressed and we see the rates of drug and alcoholc consumption have increased among young people,” she said. 

Participants were asked to bring sporting items they no longer use to the march, which will be donated to the Quebec Student Sport Network.

Truly shocking how the wahmens pushing the message of the Corporate State Complex are these hideous wildebeasts, yet the wahmens pushing the non-anti-social message are normal looking to outright cute. Compare the above to the below.

First of all, kill it with fire. Secondly, I think it's important to understand that these people are anti-social freaks, spiteful mutants if you will, who are willing to go along with the oppression of normal people pushed by the Donor Class, because they have built up resentment for being socially rejected by society for being freaks. It's sad, and not everyone with an extra chromosome or a meth addiction, or whatever the above creature has, is like that, but many of them are.
