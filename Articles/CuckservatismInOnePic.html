My <a href="../Articles/SERV_DerekSloanCuckTake.html">article</a> exploring the Servative response to the <a href="../Articles/SERV_DerekSloanOut.html">Cuck Power Play</a> performed by Erin O'Toole to Derek Sloan. I decided to take a look at the author, Jonathan Van Maren's article list. Some of them are fine, if impotent, anti-pornography stuff. This isn't represented by the Servative Party, so he's just shouting into a void, but still, it's fine. 

However, I stumbled onto this gem, that I think sums up Cuckservatism better than anything else ever. This was from this guys article list, unedited. It's so perfect I almost wonder if it's subersive.

It's amazing how, ocassionally, Cuck Propaganda is indistinguishable from mine.
