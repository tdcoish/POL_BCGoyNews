I wrote about this about a week ago now, in my article <a href="../Articles/BrownMetroVanChairWhines.html">Brown Metro Van Chair Whines about White People</a>, but there was an anti-white bitchfest going on in Metro Vancouver all of November. This was part of a conference called "Metro Vancouver Forums on Systemic Racism," and if you don't feel like reading this entire article, it happened to be entirely what you'd expect.

I decided to write this article to allow you, goy, to get to know the characters at this event just a little bit better. I am going by the list they provide of themselves on their website.

I could link you to the longer bio they give at UBC's official website, but it's much the same. Very typical vague achievements, and a cushy job with CBC, that your taxes pay for. "Social Justice," == "Anti-Whitism + Pervertism," and she appears to have a specialty trying to incite the Abos against White People.

Take a look at this guys face. Now understand that he has a Doctorate. Now understand that he's been put into a position with some amount of power and influence. At the very least, he can fail White Kids who are taking his courses for crossing the line.

As for Yabome, well the bio really sums it up. I took a cursory look at "SDL Consulting," and according to their website, <a href="https://sldconsulting.org/about-yabome-gilpin-jackson/">SLD Consulting INC.</a> they're all about "facilitating transformative learning for leadership and development." It's a lot of garbage, basically. 

And as for "International African Woman of the Year"...

Few things of note with Mr. Yellowfly. First, that's a White Man. I'm sorry, he just is. I'm not proud of it, but we have to claim him. That man is White. I saw a lot of other pictures when writing this article. That's not weird lighting, he's White.

Second, that picture looks like the cringiest school events I was forced to be a part of as a kid. Some Abo, or in this case, a White Man LARPing as an Abo, comes into your school and gives you the absolute shittiest musical experience of your life. And it's really cringey, and you actually kind of feel bad for the loser on stage doing the song and dance routine. Although now, as an adult, I'm just pissed that the government pays for that garbage.

"Intergenerational Impact of Residential Schools on his family," that sounds like some complete bullshit. It's a fairly common anti-white tactic though. When they can't explain how they've been victimized, they just pass down imaginary victimhood from previous generations.

I couldn't find a picture of Tammy Hu on the internet, so I took this one from the video they have. I don't know what's funnier, the picture, or the bio. Literally every single sentence gave me a mini-thunderstriking. I had no idea there was something called the "Homebody Championship," nor a "rookie league in Vancouver TheatreSports," and frankly, if they just made that up to fuck with us, I wouldn't know the difference.

UBC Migration Center is yet another thing I'm going to have to write about. Amazing how they have a <a href="../Articles/UBCSocialJusticeInstitutePart1.html">Social Justice Center</a>, but also a "Migration Center". I think I might have to start making a list of all the donors to UBC. 

As for the rest of it, well it's pretty standard stuff.

Classical Anti-White, and maybe the most serious person on this list. He seems to have some vague, but real political connections inside the Donor-Center Party Federally. He also started, or at least heavily promoted the "#HandsAgainstRacism," an Anti-White Campaign, that gets Anti-Whites to hold their hands up to "fight against Racism." No mention of course of racial discrimination against Whites in, say, University Application. Their website, <a href="http://handsagainstracism.com/">Hands Against Racism</a>, is actually pretty bad, giving me a whole bunch of warnings at the top of the page, and having a few other oddities. 

So there you have it, these are the speakers at the "Forum against Systemic Racism," put on by Metro Vancouver.
