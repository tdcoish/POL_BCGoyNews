In a previous article I wrote, <a href="../Articles/FutureOfBCLiberalParty.html">here</a>, my eye was drawn to BC Liberal Party Chair Nicole Paul. Her comments were typical Globo Homo Schlomo fair, which begs the question, who is she? Well I found her biography from when she worked for the <a href="https://www.national.ca/en/authors/nicole-paul/">National.</a>
TDC_ARTICLE_START
As a Senior Consultant for NATIONAL Public Relations Public Affairs team in Vancouver, Nicole develops and implements strategic public affairs campaigns for clients in multiple sectors. Prior to joining NATIONAL, Nicole developed a strong background in public affairs, government relations and communications, through her previous work in the public, private, and not-for-profit sectors. She has worked in political, government, government relations and communications roles previously across a variety of industries, including extensive experience with the natural resource sector gained through her role in developing campaigns about responsible resource development in BC at Resource Works.

Does this sound like someone you know? In your personal life, is there someone who has this work history? Of course not, but this is who is installed deep into every single Donor Class Approved Party.

Drawing on her diverse experiences, Ms. Paul provides her clients expertise in communications, event management and digital needs as well as insight in public policy development and community, stakeholder, and member relations.

A veteran of working on over 20 political campaigns at the federal, provincial, and municipal level, Nicole brings with her a deep understanding of the BC political landscape. As President of the BC Young Liberals during the 2013 provincial election, Nicole successfully directed the partyâ€™s youth campaign; her efforts resulted in significantly raising youth engagement levels across all regions of BC. She also served as an official party spokesperson during this period, appearing regularly in broadcast and print media.

Well thank god we finally have someone in the BC Liberal Party who really represents the common man. Someone with the diverse experiences, none of which involve hard manual labour, that are critical to understanding that Trannies == GOOD.

And this whole President of the BC Young Liberals thing, that's what <a href="../Articles/BCLiberalsMovingForward.html">Simrath Grewal</a> was a member of. You may remember that his article that I wrote about was promoted by her. I will have to look into this BC Young Liberals group, but it sounds super gay, and frankly not that important.

I just wanted to show you who is calling the shots inside the BC Liberal Party.
