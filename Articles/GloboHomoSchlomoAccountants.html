This is an old article that I never got around to actually finishing. You can see that I clearly started this in May, but am only now publishing this in June. It has become far more relevant recently.

When studying the "SFU Equity Diversity and Inclusion," program, where 10% of their students are selected from the vague, but probably anti-White criterion of "diverse," as measured by their "diversity meter," I stumbled upon the Canadian Centre for Diversity and Inclusion, or CCDI. So what is this CCDI, who founded it, and what does it do? 

Well it turns out it was founded by one Michael Bach, who conveniently has a biography of himself on the Canadian Centre for Diversity and Inclusion.

Man, I thought I was padding my resume when applying for minimum wage jobs as a 14 year old. "Managed trays of donuts," "took on personal responsibility as hockey alternate captain." My brain needs a second to come down from the diversity diversity diversity Diversity diversity repetition. I will also have to now look up the EEA and AODO acts.

BTW, keep in mind, Amazon has been on record claiming that they increase worker "diversity," specifically so as to destroy worker cohesion, and destroy unionization efforts. So capitalists, billionaires, whatever you want to call the Corporate part of the Corporate-State Complex, absolutely love diversity. It means they can destroy and exploit their workers much more effectively.

Uhm. Multiple awards for diversity? Multiple, PRESTIGIOUS awards? Canada's Top Employers for Diversity. My brain is just a little baffled at these people. You'll see in my next article that KPMG is also a criminal enterprise, but we'll get there later.

Oh my god it just never ends. Just the sheer tedium of the privileged class, it simply makes my eyes roll. I have to admit, I drift, I just sort of skim this kind of shit now and move on.

However, the important takeaway you should have gotten there is that he himself is a mentally ill pervert who loves mens assholes. Or maybe loves penis in his asshole, it's not really clear which one he is. So Globo Homo Schlomo indeed, and I certainly hope the reader at this point is not surprised in the slightest by an international accounting firm being full of homophiliacs pushing anti-White policies.

Remember this the next time you hear some Cuckservative doing the whole "muh capitalism good," routine.

A... "Post Graduate Certificate in Diversity Management from Cornell University." I mean I could quote the rest, but I honestly did not know that there was such a thing.

Anyway, so mentally ill pervert with a fetish for mens assholes spends his career pushing anti-White and anti-Normal policies for KPMG. 

Weirdly his CCDI page directs to a non-used twatter account of his. He has another which he links, but it got suspended.
<img src="../Images/diversityDudeSuspended.PNG">
If you have a twitter account @DiversityDudeMB, and you get suspended, you have to be pushing some undenable anti-White hate speech, or basically be repeatedly advocating for pedophilia. Twatter won't say which one, but I just wanted to mention that, in case you think that this homophiliac is a really great person or whatever.

His active twatter account has 10.4k followers, and follows over 8k other accounts. Which seems fairly impressive, until you see the actual engagement that his tweets get.
<img src="../Images/michaelBachTwatter.PNG">
I picked tweets from a day ago, because I wanted to make sure that everyone can see this guys tweets get absolutely no play. He has no real organic base of support, and no one normal gives a fuck. However, he is connected and inserted into the privileged class, which is, for now, what's really important.
