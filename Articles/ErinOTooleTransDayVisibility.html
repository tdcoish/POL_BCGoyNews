Oh sweet jesus make it stop. I don't think I can take much more of the Servative Party. Like, I didn't expect them to be this fake and gay, I thought they would do some anti-tranny rhetoric, that never lead to policy. Apparently, I was wrong.

But speaking of fake and gay, I might as well point out that The Post Millenial is a really shitty site from a technical standpoint. This very page started using over 1 GB of my computers memory, which, when combined with the other things I had open, caused my computer to use all 8GBs of memory. After closing it and reopening it, now it's down to ~300 MBs again. Fucking conservatives suck at everything.

O'Toole's tweet aligns with his campaign's message from the get-go, as the leader has made attempts to appeal to a broader range of Canadians.
During his speech after winning the Conservative Party Leadership contest, O'Toole noted that he "want[s] more Canadians to see a Conservative when they look in the mirror."

There is literally nothing that has a broader appeal to people than "these trannies are weirdo freaks and they're maliciously trying to force wahmens to wax their 'female' balls". "No trannies in the women's bathroom or sports," is literally the one policy that you could have to broad appeal to 95% of people. Well that and "no child trannies period." But the Servative Party exists to get out in front of the little people's response to their oppressors, and make sure that it goes nowhere. So they can't actually run on those policies, because then people would get re-engaged with politics and demand they actually do that.

BTW this fucking Post Millenial page has steadily rocketed back up in memory usage and is now at 500 MBs again. Oop, now well over 500 MBs. God Conservatives suck.

O'Toole has framed his party of one of openness for people who are determined, who work hard, and want to be respected. "These ideals will ensure more Canadians see a Conservative when they look in the mirror, and feel good about voting for a party that will get this country moving again," he said. "I want all Canadians to feel welcome in the Conservative Party of Canada."
