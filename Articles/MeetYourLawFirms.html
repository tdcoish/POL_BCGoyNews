When writing up my <a href="../Articles/CalinRovinescu.html">article</a> on Calin Rovinescu, I noticed that he managed to become, quite quickly goy, a "managing partner at Stikeman Elliot." I did a little research into Stikeman Elliot LLP, and I found that they are one of six law firms known as the "Seven Sisters."

I know, but apparently there used to be seven, and now there are six. That the nickname given to these gigantic corporate law firms was "Seven Sisters," shows how weird and insular the legal profession really is, but what's really important is just how much money these law firms rake in every year. Before scrolling down, take a guess at two numbers, the total revenue, and the revenue per lawyer at these firms. Okay, here it is.

Yep. About half a billion dollars in revenue per year, goy. Everything above board, goy. And these Canadian Firms top out at 78th on the Global Rank. 78th. Out of sheer curiosity I decided to look up what the largest law firms in the world were. Apparently number one is a firm called "Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz," and they make over $6.3 million USD per equity partner. 

Good people I'm sure.
