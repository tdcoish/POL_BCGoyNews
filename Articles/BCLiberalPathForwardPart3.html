As part of my ongoing series on bringing to you what BC Liberal Party Insiders want you to think the future of the BC Liberal Party. Or rather, the internal discussion they are having, whether they care are privy to this or not. This one if from former Cuckservative National Campaign Director Hamish Marshall, and it's more true, and therefore far more insidious, than the other takes.

Last week’s election drubbing should force the BC Liberals and the broad free-enterprise coalition to take stock and evaluate what they offer, and how they fight elections. Here are four things they need to do in order to win again:

1. Take the splintering of the right seriously
Once again, the BC Conservatives cost the BC Liberal seats. But it wasn’t just the BC Conservatives, the overperformance of small right-wing parties, or mishandling the Laurie Throness situation, which handed the NDP a bigger victory. In all, at least six seats were lost by the BC Liberals because of conservative-minded voters going elsewhere.

It was easy to dismiss the BC Conservatives because they only ran 19 candidates, but in those ridings, they got 10.4% of the vote. The BC Liberals need to do what Christy Clark did when faced with a far more organized BC Conservative Party before the 2013 election. Not only did they present a pro-energy resource development platform which appealed to Conservatives, they recruited activists, got Stockwell Day and Chuck Strahl involved in the campaign, and basically handed John Martin, a one-time BC Conservative candidate in Chilliwack, the BC Liberal nomination.

They took the threat seriously and won as a result. That has to be the default position of the BC Liberals going forward, not the exception.

First of all, take a look at this guy, and keep this face in mind as you walk through his critique. Also, check out the weirdness of a guy deep in the National Conservative Party talking about strategies to destroy the BC Provincial Conservative Party. Really gets the noggin joggin.

However, he's onto something that's about half real. First, as much of an unserious do-nothing party the BC Conservatives are, they managed to have enough power to legitimately destroy the BC Liberals in six ridings. That assumes that those who voted for them would have voted for the Liberals, which isn't necessarily true. I think a lot of people are just beyond tired of the BC Liberals doing their fake and literally gay routine, and won't vote for them. But it is unquestionably true that some percent of those voters would have voted for the BC Liberal Party, had the Conservatives not run a candidate, and possibly won those elections. 

But you'll notice that Hamish's strategies for getting these people back is completely fake and gay. Nobody switched their vote from BC Liberals to BC Cuckservatives, because they felt the BC Liberals did not have a "pro-energy" stance. That's not real. What's real is people who see White Privilege bullshit and tranny shit, and desperately want some way out, and do not feel that the BC Liberals are going to do jack shit for them.

To quantify the Conservative "success," they won 1.90% of the vote this election, and contested 19 ridings, getting about 10% of the vote in those ridings on average, and finishing second in two of them. In the previous election, 2017, they had no leader, 10 candidates, and got 0.53% of the vote.

The BC liberals, in contrast, lost a full 15 seats, with their vote share dwindling from 40.37% of the vote, -6.6% to 33.77% of the vote. This continues a trend for them, where they've gone from getting 44% of the vote in 2013 down now a full 10%, and from 49 seats down 21 full seats to 28, despite their being 2 additional seats in the legislature, from 85 to 87.

2. Recapture the Chinese-Canadian vote
One of the most interesting and underreported trends of the last decade has been the decline of the BC Liberals with voters of Chinese descent. In this election, of the 15 seats with the most Chinese voters, they won three. Each of these ridings is at least 20% Chinese — and that number is not decreasing. The ultimate example is the BC Liberals losing three of four seats in Richmond, a former stronghold.

In 2013 the BC Liberals won 9 of these 15 seats (if they were on the present boundaries) and this dropped to 7 in 2017. BC Liberal vote dropped in ridings with the most Chinese-Canadians from 46% in 2013 (better than they did provincewide) to 40% in 2017, and down to just 36% last week.

There is no path back to victory that does not include winning this community by a significant margin. This has to be a top priority of the new leader.

Question, does anyone here know what the percentage of the White Vote the BC Liberals won this time around? And how does that compare to previous elections? To paraphrase Mike Enoch, I am amazed at how unwilling these propagandists are to even mention White People, when we're in the majority, and are therefore critical to winning elections. I am also amazed at how difficult it is to answer the previous two questions, despite these people obviously having the data, as evidenced by them breaking down the Chinese Vote. 

And I'm not kidding when I say it's difficult, bordering on impossible for me to find this stuff out. Getting a vote breakdown by race for the 2020 BC Provincial Election has proven completely impossible for me. 

As far as winning Chinese Votes, you could easily do that just by actually going hard on the Pervertism, and not being complete and utter corporate whores. Nobody likes that, and this would also win you the White Vote, which they refuse to even mention.

3. Give people a reason to vote for them
For much of the Campbell-Clark years, the core message in elections was the NDP was too risky to be trusted in government. It was very effective, and almost worked in 2017. But after four years of the Horgan version of the NDP being less scary, less erratic, and downright more likeable than those who ran the province in the ’90s, that message has no hope of success.

The only way to win is to land some punches on Horgan, damage his brand, and more than anything else put forward a positive and distinct vision of the province. Being “New Democrats who are good at math” is not enough to win. The lowest point of the BC Liberal saga was Christy Clark’s embarrassing “clone speech” of 2017 when she basically promised to implement the NDP platform to stave off losing power. Given the choice between the real version of a party and a fake, one voters will choose the real one.

It's like this guy is consistently 20% of the way to the real answer. Nobody wants the BC Liberals, because everyone can see that they are completely fake, and exist to serve their moneyed masters. On top of this, if they're offering the exact same platform as the NDP, why not vote for the NDP? The NDP is also a Donor Approved Party, and all of their moderately good economic stuff is completely fake, but they are more plausible on those issues in the eyes of the general public. And if you're getting all the Pervertism and Anti-Whitism from the Liberals or the NDP, why would anyone vote for the explicitly corporate whore party?

Rather than the NDP becoming "less scary, less erratic, and downright more likeable," it is the BC Liberals who have become more scary, more erratic, and downright less likeable, than previously, mostly as an attempt to chase the NDP's anti-white and pro-pervert policies. In reality, this is a result of their donor preferences, so nothing can be done, short of destroying the party.

4. Fresh new leader, and a fresh new brand
The next leader has to be a new face — or at least someone who understands how the world has changed. A reincarnation of Gordon Campbell or Christy Clark would be suicide. Their formula worked in their circumstances, but things are different now.

Along with a new leader, the BC Liberals need to change their name. The Liberal brand is too tied to what is happening federally (for good or ill) and turns off too many Conservative-minded folks. A party’s name should be a net positive, not a net negative when comes to attracting voters, donors, and volunteers. There is no reason party members could not be given a short list of names to choose from, and vote online to rebrand the party.

With a new leader, a new brand, a clear vision for BC and an understanding of which voters to go after, the free-enterprise party can win again.

The formula of being a corporate whore, whilst also pushing Pervertism is not going to work here sweetheart. As far as turning off Conservative Voters, well maybe it's not a good idea to literally have your party be called the Liberal Party. Sort of an unforced error that one. 

But we can see one again, they absolutely refuse to be anything other than the Explicit Corporate Whore Party. And by being in opposition, they legitimize the NDP's pretend economic populism, which will never actually translate into policy. And if there's anyone reading this who does not yet understand the shot, "free-enterprise party," very much does not mean "anti-bureaucrat party," like you may have been hoping. It means "anything for billionaires, party". There will not be a single corporate subsidy, or outright bailout that these utter whores will turn down, no matter how many elections they lose because of it. It also signals their complete and utter unwillingness to actually fight not just for White People, but even for normal everyday people tired of the Pervertism being thrown in their face.

All of which is good for us, because it opens up an opportunity for us to capitalize on.
