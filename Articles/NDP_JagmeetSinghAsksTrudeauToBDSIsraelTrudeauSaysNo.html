TDC_ARTICLE_START
Federal NDP leader Jagmeet Singh has called on the government to block arms sales to Israel amid escalating violence in the Middle East.

Singh accused the Liberal government of “arming one side of the conflict” by allowing military exports to Israel. The policy “is undermining the peace process and supporting illegal occupation,” he said in the House of Commons May 12.

"Arming one side of the conflict," LOL, get a load of this language. You'll notice that Jagmeet Singh refers to the violent racial cleansing of Palestinian Goy-Cattle as a "conflict." Show me another conflict like this one please, Mr. Singh. A massacre of civilians from airstrikes brought explicitly in the name of racial cleansing in the name of Jew Nationalism is not a "conflict."

With an NDP like this, who needs Conservatives?
TDC_ARTICLE_START
Singh was echoing a new NDP policy passed at the party’s convention last month. A resolution approved by 80 percent of delegates charged that Canada and Israel “trade millions in arms facilitating an illegal occupation,” and called for an arms embargo against Israel “until Palestinian rights are upheld.”

The NDP leader asked Prime Minister Justin Trudeau whether the government would “commit to stopping the sale of arms to Israel while they are violating international human rights.”

Trudeau said Canada is “following the situation with grave concern. We call on all parties to end the violence, de-escalate tensions, protect civilians and uphold international law. Rocket attacks against Israel are completely unacceptable and Canada supports Israel’s right to assure its own security. Violence at Al-Aqsa is also unacceptable. Places of worship are for people to gather peacefully and should never be sites of violence. We’re also gravely concerned by continued expansion of settlements and evictions. Canada supports the two-state solution and we urge all parties to renew their commitment to peace and security.”

Government data show Canada exported $13.7 million worth of military goods and technology to Israel in 2019, or 0.4 percent of total arms exports.

So Jagmeet Singh's big idea for stopping the violent racial cleansing of Palestinian Goyim is to... literally ask some other guy to do a thing, which wouldn't make any difference anyway, and then that guy said no.

To explain this concisely.
1) Stopping giving 13 million of random military hardware to the jew ethnostate is completely irrelevant, and nobody would notice.
2) Jagmeet Singh's plan here, was to ask Joffrey Trudeau to do this.
3) And then Joffrey said no anyway.

I mean I have no words. This might somehow be even faker than Conservative advocacy for White People, because very occasionally the interests of White People align with the interests of the ultra rich donors that the CuckoldServatives actually serve, and so we get something. Like "tough on crime," stuff occasionally happens. I know, it's by accident, and it's rare, but the NDP and the Liberals will never in 10,000 years ever do a single thing for the Palestinians.

Jew Nationalist Pro-Racial Cleansing organizations like the Centre for Israel and Jewish Advocacy (CIJA) on the other hand, you better believe that they get on their knees and give them that good lovin.
