For my overview of the Yannick Bandaogo North Vancouver Stabbing Case, please read <a href="../Articles/YannickBandagaoStabbingCase.html">this article first.</a>
That story ended with me getting ready to join Bandaogo's scheduled court appearance on April 1st. After numerous back and forth calls between myself and the North Vancouver Court Registry, I managed to both get a link to the Microsoft Teams call, as well as the scheduled time. There was one really interesting part of this, which I unfortunately didn't get on OBS studio, which is when the court administrators were directly talking to me about some technical details. I was having problems with the Teams software earlier, and my camera was enabled, which caused them some problems on their end. 

The interesting part is that I swear to got I heard someone say "he's the White Supremacist," in the background. I would even go so far as to say it might have been the judge herself, although maybe not, it could have been her voice. Still, it was this weird out of body experience.

Anyway, I didn't get it on camera, unfortunately, but I did get pretty much the entire part about Yannick Bandaogo. It's not that interesting, lots of procedural details about them getting him a lawyer, and his English difficulties. Nothing of enormous interest was learnt here, but you can watch the video below if you would like, for your own interest. The only interesting takeaways are that Bandaogo has some bandaging/casting on his left arm, and his next court appearance will be on the sixth. However, it's also going to be some dry procedural stuff, that's not too interesting.

After this, I again called the North Vancouver Court Registry, and inquired into more interesting matters. First, who was ultimately responsible for the publication ban, and why? To clarify, the ban on publicising the names of Yannick Bandaogo's victims. Second, how do I find out the length of time on this publication ban? Third, is there any way for me to either directly contact the judge, or as spokesperson for the court, who can explain the rationale for this ban? Fourth, how do I go about accomplishing that?

That was all yesterday, today I couldn't do all that much, because nothing was open due to Good Friday. This was quite unfortunate, as it means that I will have to wait until April 5th for much of the followup.
