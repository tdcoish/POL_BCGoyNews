This is yet again another article I should have written back in late October, but am writing now. Better late than never.

TDC_ARTICLE_START
Saturday’s provincial election once again confirmed that there is only room for one centre-right political party in British Columbia, at least for those who don’t want an NDP government.

The angle here is pretty transparent. The BC Conservatives are a LOLcow, and I'm glad they didn't win a single seat in this election, because that makes space for us. Having said that, the Liberal Party of BC, well I mean I don't know what to say, they're literally called the LIBERAL Party. I mean I hate to sound like a Boomer here but come on, this isn't that hard. They are exactly what you would expect from a Donor-Center party. They advertize themselves as being a "free market party," but they're also really big on trannies. BC Local Jews wants even the cuckiest challenge to the Donor-Center gone.

Both in 2012 and in the 2020 election, the combined BC Liberal and BC Conservative vote totals were greater than the number the NDP received. In the Chilliwack riding, before mail-in ballots have been counted, Dan Coulter of the NDP leads with 4,575 votes over incumbent John Martin with 3,512 votes. BC Conservative candidate Diane Janzen finished third with 2,190.

“With the BC Conservatives landing in third place in both the 2012 byelection and this year’s general election, this seems to confirm the long-held view (since the 1950s) that there isn’t enough room on the political spectrum under the ‘first-past-the-post’ electoral system for two free-enterprise parties to compete against each other without electing the NDP,” Penner said.

There isn't enough room for one free-enterprise party, because "free-enterprise," seems to never mean "I'm going to take a hatchet to these bureaucrats kneecaps," and instead seems to mean "I'll do whatever my corporate masters would like." I said before, the Liberal Party literally has nothing to offer anyone, other than "look how crazy the NDP is," which apparently was not enough this election.

“British Columbia will have a large fiscal hangover to deal with in coming years as a result of unprecedented deficit spending. While predicting the future is always a risky undertaking, there’s a good chance this will be a dominant issue for the next election – along with who has the willingness and skill to put B.C. on a solid footing following the pandemic to sustain funding of healthcare, education, environmental and other social priorities.”

On specifics, and related to Chilliwack-Kent, Jas Johal, who was the BC Liberal member for Richmond-Queensborough until his defeat in Saturday’s election, said the party needs to do more to support the diversity and rights of LGBTQ people and others.

Wow it's just so shocking that nobody wants to vote for the BC Liberals. I mean I am more than shocked. Fiscal Conservatism in the middle of a fucking government created shutdown, coupled with pushing harder the faggot shit. You can't make this up folks.
TDC_ARTICLE_START
In an interview with The Canadian Press, Johal pointed directly to Laurie Throness who was ousted from the BC Liberals after the latest in a string of comments leader Andrew Wilkinson said were unacceptable.

“When you think you can convert somebody who is gay to a heterosexual life, I think that’s absurd,” Johal said, referring to former Throness who placed advertisements in a magazine supporting conversion therapy.

“So in 2020, B.C. voters inflicted renewal on the party and that’s what you’re seeing now,” he said. “When you lose the amount of seats that we did in what was once solid B.C. Liberal territory, it’s a wake-up call. To be very blunt, B.C. voters took us to the back of the barn and gave us a thumping.”
TDC_ARTICLE_STOP
Once again, this is of course gaslighting. Billionaire funded media would like you to believe that the way to win elections is by, through pure coincidence, pushing exactly their agenda. In reality, voters took them to the back of the barn and "gave them a thumping," because they are offering nothing to anyone.

But this is a good thing! I have never said that "worse is better," in some general way. However, the worse that Donor Funded Parties become, as in the more distant from anything the peasants want, the more easily we can get our party in there and running. The BC Liberals gave nobody a single reason to vote for them, but people still did vote for them as a way to escape the NDP. As the destruction of the Alberta Liberals from 1992-2012 has shown, political parties do not exist forever, and can be destroyed in a heartbeat.
