There are times when a single image speaks 10,000 words.

Imagine looking at this and going: "wow, thank god cuckservatives are morally superior," as Netflix puts this out: 
<img src="../Images/amazonCuties.jpg"><figcaption>These actresses are actually 11 years old.</figcaption>
This is a movie Netflix created. Funded entirely by them. A movie about 11 year old girls being hyper sexualized, with only the absolute fakest veneer of a critical eye. A movie that has 11 year old girls gyrating like strippers in multiple scenes for an audience of perverts. 

Imagine being really proud that Cuckservatives aren't rioting or burning anything down.
<img src="../Images/desmondIsAmazing.jpg"><figcaption>8 year old boy</figcaption>
Here's "Desmond is Amazing," surrounded by two faggots who are probably sexually abusing him. Desmond is an 8 year old boy with a mental illness, who is being abused by the adults in his life, who are using him as clout against other perverts, and probably sexually.
Imagine being really proud that Cuckservatives aren't rioting or burning anything down.

This guy has a net worth of over 250 billion dollars, while 51% of Canadians between the ages of 20-29 live at home with their parents, a number pre-Covid, and most people my age have given up on ever owning a home, and having the normal life that was taken for granted by previous generations. Imagine drowning in debt, with no financial hope for the future, and this fucking 5'2 googly eyed weirdo controls what you are or are not allowed to sell on the internet.

Here's a picture from CNN about the anti-white pograms that the propagandists created. Pograms that started after a guy who literally pointed a loaded shotgun at a womans pregnant belly when breaking into her home in search of drugs and money, ingested his own stash of fentanyl and killed himself in police custody. The above is how these propagandists treat these events.

Here's a statue of Founding Father of America, George Washington, being torn down by BLM and Antifa.

Here's a statement by the "UBC Social Justice Institute," that your taxes paid for.

Here's a picture of a dead US Soldier, dead for the racial interests of Zionist Jews, and the Financial Interest of Lockheed Martin.

Here's another.

Hey, Raytheon has to meet quarterly four earnings estimations somehow you fucking peasant.

Here's a mural of them all. 

Of course, the Donor-Right supports this. These are just filthy peasants, who exist to serve them. No real people were killed in the making of the above photos.

And you better believe that if you should say to them "I want reparations for the families of all our soldiers murdered in Afghanistan," that they would get some closed door meetings, and find a way to make an example of you.

Oh but stop racial discrimination against White People? Stop Mass Migration? Stop Abortion? Stop Outsourcing of Jobs? Stop Child Abuse? Stop Massive Tech Censorship by Multi-National Conglomerates with trillion dollar evaluations?

LOL

No sorry goy, we're just here to give Billionaires and Schlomo everything they want. Go fuck yourself.

And I wish I had a better ending to this, but I really just fucking hate these people. 
<img src="../Images/impotenceOfCuckservatives.PNG"><figcaption>You can steal elections from Donor-Right and we won't do anything. YAY!</figcaption>
Don't think for one second that they act this way when it comes to something their donors want. Don't think for one second that this propaganda is anything other than trying to condition you to accepting losses as some sort of pathetic moral victory. He's right after all, 70 million Non-Player-Characters deeply invested in Donor-Right politics, believing an election was stolen from them.

And not one single building burned to the ground.

I have <a href="../Articles/PSA_CopFinkelthink.html">said before, </a> and I'll say again. In the same way that Economic Leftism is the way to get "Fuck Jeff Bezos," to go absolutely nowhere. Cuckservatism is the way to get "Fuck Anti-Whites," or "Fuck Child Abusing Perverts," and definitely "Fuck Zionist Jews," to go absolutely nowhere. That's it.

The point is to make sure that you get nothing. That you always lose. And that a genuine movement of the people can never possibly happen. But there's a certain point, where the absolute impotence, when it comes to what you want, becomes to obvious, and too undeniable. And in that time, what the people need is a political machine that exists for them. Not the billionaires, but them.
