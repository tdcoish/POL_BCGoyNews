I <a href="../Articles/YANIV_CallsFireDepartment30Times.html">wrote earlier</a> about Jessica Yaniv, real name Jonathan Simpson, calling the Langley Fire Department 30 times to help him get out of his bathtub, before they got sick and tired of this and threatened legal action. Yaniv's response to this was "I guess they don't like trans vaginas," which is a statement indistinguishable from what I would say to make fun of trannies. Really, the entire situation is indistinguishable from parody.

Anyway, for a brief history of Yaniv, he's basically the epitomy of Vicious Clown, more towards the Clown end. He rose to infamy for filing human rights complaints against beauticians for refusing to wax his balls. No really, he went in there, claimed to be a woman, then sued them for calling him a man. Except that he is a man. I mean he hadn't even chopped his balls and cock off at that point. He had a fucking penis. He sued a bunch of women out of business because they refused to wax his balls that he was pretending to be a vagina.

I think that last part bears repeating. This mentally ill man has put multiple women out of business, and tried to get them thrown in jail, because they refused to wax his balls that he was pretending was a vagina. Or maybe he was pretending to be a woman with balls. It doesn't really matter. It's just one of those "Is this reality?" type events that nevertheless happened. And oh BTW, only a tiny amount of feminists denounced this absurd example of a man oppressing women, and the ones that did were heavily censored, like Meghan Murphy. 

As an aside, I think I'll write up an article on Murphy, because she's an interesting character.

Here are some other hilights of Yaniv's from a Gateway Pundit article. <a href="https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2019/12/wax-my-balls-trans-activist-jessica-yaniv-angry-after-gynecologist-refuses-to-treat-him-because-hes-a-biological-male/">Gateway Pundit:</a>
TDC_ARTICLE_START
Yaniv, a Canadian, previously sued female estheticians who refused to give him a Brazilian wax on his balls — he lost the lawsuits so now he’s onto the next attention seeking mission.

Yaniv, a biological male was also caught sending sexually explicit messages to underage teenagers and even expressed how he would assist 10-year-old girls who needed help with their menstrual cycles.

He also applied for a permit to throw a topless pool party for underage girls and said the parents would be barred from attending.

Why is this perverted creep still walking around freely in society?

Why indeed?
