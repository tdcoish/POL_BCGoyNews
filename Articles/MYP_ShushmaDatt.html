Shushma Datt caught my eye, being linked to both Harsha Walia, as well as Sav Dhaliwal. So I decided to look into her a little more, in conjunction with a look into "Spice Radio," a "Canadian Ethnic Radio Broadcasting Station."

Shushma Datt is a pioneer in the broadcasting industry in Canada. This talented woman is credited with being the first Indo-Canadian broadcaster in the country. At a time when ethnic programming was minimal in the 1970s, she became a radio and television host in Vancouver as well as a producer of content for the South Asian community. She is also believed to be the first Canadian women to be granted a radio license from the CRTC.

Hmmmmmmm. That's interesting. The very first Canadian Woman to be granted a radio license from the CRTC was brown. This back when the country was 99% White. So, the odds of that happening are 1%. This is very interesting to me. I wonder who specifically was involved in the decision to give a brown woman a radio license over a White Woman.

Born and raised in Kenya, Shushma Datt earned a university degree from the University of New Delhi in India. She began her career in journalism by working as a reporter for the Times of India. Shushma moved to London, England, where she was employed by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).

"It was the BBC who set me on my path as a journalist and broadcaster," remembers Shushma. "They saw some talent in me and encouraged me to write and produce programs, and they provided me with the opportunity to showcase them." She strived to be a first-rate journalist - and dreamed of owning her own radio station.

Born in Kenya, degree from India, starts propaganda career in England, now here in BC. A dutiful servant of the privileged and powerful. Nice to see the BBC, funded by the blood of the English People, gave special treatment to a non-White, non-English, brown woman because they "saw some talent in me." I'm sure there were no English People who could have used those opportunities.

Shushma Datt emigrated to Canada in 1972 and settled in Vancouver. She began working as a radio operator for CHQM and a host for Indian programming at CJVB, where she was the first announcer to broadcast in Hindi and Punjabi. By 1976 she began producing programs for the South Asian community and developing her expertise in business. She created i.t. Productions Ltd. in 1984 and starting in 1987 was responsible for broadcasting a 24-hour radio station called the "Rim Jhim" network. This was the first station in the world, outside of India, to produce dedicated programming around the clock for South Asians. Shusham was able to provide Indo Canadian listeners in British Columbia with news as well as entertainment. After a twenty-year process, Shushma Datt received a license from the CRTC in 2005 to establish an AM station in Vancouver: RJ1200.

So she ran a channel for brown people. She's this typical low grade anti-White, where she absolutely hates doing any entertainment or news for White People. Her channel shows things like "hey, here's some random black sprinter from BC, here's some other non-White". It's not so much her, it's the characters she's promoted, but we'll get there later.

Shushma Datt currently operates Radio Rim Jhim and RJ1200, as well as producing nine television programs on Shaw Cable Television and OMNI TV. These include "Women in Focus". Shusham strives to be an ambassador for the South Asian community as well as encourage young women in the group to consider non-traditional roles. She also promotes greater understanding between different cultures.

I'll be looking in to every single one of those.

n 2007 Shushma Datt received the Influential Women in Business Award (BC) for her many accomplishments in broadcasting and multicultural programming. She has also received the Order of British Columbia, the Queen's Golden Jubilee Commemorative Medal, the YWCA's "Women of Distinction" Award and the Humanitarian Award from the Vancouver Multicultural Society. Shushma is active in the community, serving on the board of the MS Society of Canada as well a director for the Vancouver General Hospital and Mount St. Joseph's Hospital.

I have to say, I am not impressed by a string of random bullshit awards such as the "YWCA Women of Distinction Award." Honestly, in this day and age, sports awards are pretty much the only awards I have any real appreciation for. 

Interesting that she serves as a director for Van General Hospital and Mount St. Joseph's Hospital, considering she has zero medical experience. I bet that she's doing some anti-White shakedown.
