The leader of the B.C. Liberals insists now is not the time for austerity.
Andrew Wilkinson says concerns about the growing provincial deficit need to take a backseat to pandemic recovery measures.
"This is the time to invest in people," he told CBC News during an interview this week. "We're in kind of a wartime economy right now, and government has to borrow and government has to invest because we all have to stick together and pull each other up."
Wilkinson made the comments while again talking about his marquee plan to axe the provincial sales tax or PST for one year, and the roughly $7-billion hit to government revenue that would entail. A Liberal government would bring back the sales tax after one year, but at the reduced level of three per cent rather than today's seven per cent.
It's his party's biggest promise of the campaign to date, and he paired the announcement with an assurance that, if elected, a B.C. Liberal government would not cut spending to health care or education to make up for the loss.

The Liberal parties biggest election campaign promise, is getting rid of the sales tax... for one year. Then bringing it back again next year. Oh boy oh boy do these guys ever have a message resonating with the voters.

Wilkinson also announced his party's platform on childcare Friday, saying a Liberal government would introduce $10-a-day daycare for families making less than $60,000 per year, rising to $30 a day for families making up to $125,000. 
He's since suggested there would be no cuts to government spending at all, and has no qualms about sinking the province deeper into debt.
So will voters be surprised to hear this coming from a party that has long championed fiscal restraint?

Actually, if you explain to people that 1 billion of their money goes to “combat global warming,” then actually yeah they will support cuts for that. One of the best bits of propaganda that these people have managed, is to make it almost impossible for the layperson to find out not simply where their money gets spent, but simple questions like “How much money does the BC provincial government spend per year?” Or “what is the current deficit/surplus, yearly and accumulated.” And if people haven’t been informed by the propagandists as to how much money is spent by their government, how the fuck are they supposed to make any informed decisions in any quantitative sense? Oh that’s right, they aren’t.

BTW, the number is about $60 billion per year, as taken from <a href="https://www.bcbudget.gov.bc.ca/2018/backgrounders/2018_Backgrounder_1_Fiscal.pdf">here.</a> And let me tell you, that wasn’t easy to find at all.

"I have not heard from a single voter and I have not heard from a single party member who thinks this is the time for austerity," said Wilkinson.
B.C. is already bracing for a $13-billion budget deficit this fiscal year. Beyond the $7-billion price-tag in the first year with no PST, any future years with the tax at a proposed three per cent would tack on another $4-billion annual hit. To compare, the NDP's $1,000 cash-back promise would cost about $1.5-billion per year.

You may notice that there was a great opportunity to plop in the numbers for projected spending this year (about $60 billion), along with the GDP of BC (about $250 billion). The propagandists at CBC didn’t put that it, because they’re not trying to inform you.

Wilkinson gave no details on how his government might go about paying back that debt in the near future, nor did he express concern about how further bleeding into the red might affect B.C.'s credit rating.
"Unless we get sufficient economic growth it'll be very hard to pay it back," he replied. 
"What do we do to keep people engaged in our communities and have a sense of hope and purpose, and plan for the future? We invest in economic growth."
While it may sound unusual coming from a right-of-centre party, political experts say we've seen this type of policy shift before with fiscally conservative parties during times of trouble. 
"It seems that right-of-centre parties are willing to do this in those extreme times," said University of British Columbia associate professor of political science Gerald Baier.
Take the 2008 recession under then-prime minister Stephen Harper, when he promoted economic recovery with spending in key areas.
"There was a willingness to go in a less austere fashion — but that was very targeted," said Baier, pointing to investments the Harper government made in the auto industry. "They got some money into the system, as opposed to tax cuts that they'd have to end up paying for down the line."
There's a good chance the B.C. Liberals have also taken notes from what's happened in the province next door.
"You see how unpopular the United Conservative government is in Alberta trying to force through some of the austerity measures that they were planning before the pandemic began," Baier said. 
"So I think [the B.C. Liberals] have taken a lesson from that in seeing it as a real no-gainer rather than no-brainer," he said. "In the midst of an election, you just can't curry favour with the electorate by saying you're going to make cuts right now."

Yeah fuck Jason Kenney and the “United Conservative” party. I think this is yet another time to show that Conservatism is entirely about wars for Schlomo, and tax cuts for billionaires. Oh, also making sure that poor people don’t get healthcare. Oh, also mass migration. Any of the other shit about ending abortion, or wink wink ending anti-white discrimination vaguely, or “muh family values,” is shit they say when they feel electorally threatened, just in order to get votes. That’s just shit they have no intention of ever doing, and they’ll happily pretend that the media, or the LiBUralS, or whomever forced them to lose on those issues. In the same way that left-donor parties somehow always lose when it comes to popular economic policies, yet somehow always win when it comes to unpopular social policies.

It’s also laughable that a political party literally called the Liberals would be considered center-right, especially when they are the ones who brought in most of the Globo Homo to us. As an example, back in the early 2000’s, when the Liberals swept away the NDP, some anal-fetishist Mine Capitalist gave them $200,000 to start teaching propaganda curriculum aimed at children. 

So yeah, LOL at anyone invested in this donor fight, where apparently the hot button issues that face us are slight changes to the tax code. Young people having McJobs that pay minimum wage at age 30, or not having jobs at all? Nah, not an issue. An HIV positive Anal-Fetishist diagnosing orphaned 2 year old children as having “gender dysphoria,”? Nah, not an issue. Massive anti-white racial discrimination in university admissions, and elsewhere? Nah, not an issue. What’s really important is slight changes to the tax code, goy. 

Consume election, get excited about new election.

As always, I work on getting us organized to fight against this.
