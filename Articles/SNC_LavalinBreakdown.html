Credit belongs mostly to <a href="https://canucklaw.ca/">Canuck Law</a> for helping me understand this scandal. You can find Canuck Law at the previous link, or on his telegram channel, which you can find <a href="https://t.me/canucklaw1">here</a>.
What I'm going to do here is to break down what the "SNC-Lavelin" scandal was, or at least the important bits. Canuck Law brought me to <a href="https://canucklaw.ca/corruption-reviews-snc-lavalin/">this</a> breakdown he did. However, reading through all that would take you multiple hours. If you are really concerned, then I would recommend you hit the link, but not everyone needs to know the finer details in terms of who is giving money to McGill uni, or any other shit like that. What you need is the overview, which I'll detail below.

1) Canada never had a Deferred Prosecution Agreement historically. Contrary to the name "deferred," a DPA does not actually defer any prosecution. It simply allows the government to voluntarily not prosecute companies or individuals who break the law. The reason for a DPA is to give special treatment to politically favoured companies.
2) In 2018, we got DPA legislation. This was supported by all parties.
3) SNC-Lavelin wanted this DPA so the government could ignore their criminal activity, and not have to ban them from government contracts for 10 years.
4) SNC-Lavelin is an internationalist construction-engineering firm that is so corrupt it’s been banned from the World Bank. The specific corruption involves Libya, but it’s not really that important. We all know the archetype.
5) Jodie Wilson-Raybould, former Liberal Attorney General, refused to give SNC-Lavelin this preposterous DPA that there was no non-corrupt reason to give them.

6) She recorded audio of a Liberal Party member on the “Privy Council,” outright telling her that Trudeau wanted that DPA “one way or another.”
7) She resigned, and her replacement, who used to lobby FOR SNC-Lavelin immediately gave them the DPA, despite Wilson-Raybould making it very clear there was no reason to.
8) Then Trudeau kicked Wilson-Raybould out of the Liberal Party completely.
9) The reason the opposition parties response was so impotent, is because SNC-Lavelin lobbies them as well, both the CPC and the NDP. So they liked this result, and had to pretend to attack Trudeau.

One thing I might add is, you should keep this actual, undeniable scandal in mind when you see the Cuckservatives doing the "OMFG Joffrey Trudeau once dressed up as a brown guy 30 years ago," or the "OMFG these LibURalS are being Sawft on Chyyna," song and dance routine. There are actual objective scandals from the Trudeau Regime, and they won't bring them up because SNC-Lavelin give them money.

So, long story short, NJP.
