Metro Vancouver board of directors chair Sav Dhaliwal says racism is thriving in Canada, a serious problem that will continue to fester unless more people call out the harmful behaviour.

“Racism is alive and thriving, and not to see it or not to acknowledge it is a neglect of our moral duties as human beings,” he said Saturday, as Metro Vancouver wrapped up its four-part series of online forums to discuss systemic racism and develop strategies to address the long-standing issue.

More than 90 elected officials tuned into the region’s forums held over four Saturdays, which Dhaliwal called a good sign that leaders are listening and looking for solutions for their communities.

The objective was to raise awareness and open a dialogue, particularly with elected officials, about the gaps in the system and social inequities, he said.

The panelists’ stories that were shared during the four sessions can still be viewed online via the region’s website at metrovancouver.org/event/systemic-racism-forum.

Well, I now have even more on my already full plate. I guess I will have to take a look at what's going on at this "Metro Vancouver Forum." My quick takeaway: I'm surprised at how anti-White it is. This picture pretty much sums it up.

They shared painful experiences with racism, discussed the spike in pandemic-related racist attacks, and the harm caused by white supremacy groups.

“Racism was always there but the pandemic has blown the lid off it. It has become so apparent that many people who were racist, but overtly racist, now seem to have become brazen. They don’t care anymore. They yell or blurt out slurs, or use physical violence,” he said.

“Not a day goes by when you don’t hear about someone being assaulted or attacked with racial slurs, hurt, threatened. And many times people just stand by or don’t want to be involved,” he said.

Dhaliwal said the vast majority of people are not racist but in order to keep racism from festering people need to become anti-racists.

That means calling out racist behaviour anytime you see or hear it, and have “those hard discussions with relatives, friends, or even neighbours who exhibit racist behaviour,” he added.

Often it is easy to condone their behaviour quietly but that isn’t solving the problem, said Dhaliwal.

“We all need to take an active role in eradicating this long-standing issue in our communities. I believe all of us have a role to play to promote social equity in our lives, in our neighbourhoods and in our workplaces, and everywhere else we can think of.”

Dr. Handel Wright, UBC professor and director of the Centre for Culture, Identity and Education, gave the keynote address at Saturday’s forum, moderated by CBC broadcaster Kathryn Gretsinger.

Yes, don't worry, I have made up my mind, and I will in fact be doing a quick writeup of those involved.

This week B.C. Premier John Horgan, in forming his new cabinet, said anti-racism and equality were his top priorities, along with making life affordable, fighting climate change and reconciliation with Indigenous people.

“Racialized and marginalized people face historic and present-day barriers that limit their full participation in their communities, workplaces, government and their lives,” wrote Horgan in a covering letter to all appointees.

“Our government has a moral and ethical responsibility to tackle systemic discrimination in all its forms — and every ministry has a role in this work.”

"Racialized People," I've been hearing this more than once, and I think I've started to know what the shot is. My guess is some variation of "well it's okay for Brown People to be racially active, because we are defined in opposition to the Social Construct of Whiteness, which is a fake construct designed for White Supreeeeeemacy. Since we suffer under this, it's okay for us to do this, but not you Whitey." I think that's what they're going for, but I'm not sure. I'll have to take a closer look.

Anyway, rest assured that John Horgan will in absolutely no way make life more affordable. That's the issue he'll have a 0% win rate on. However, no mater how unpopular, he'll have a 100% win rate on Anti-Whitism and Pervertism, on behalf of his (((donors))).
