I was looking through some of our goys still on twitter, and I came across a pretty solid account. That account retweeted this tweet by Jagmeet Singh.

This kind of hateful language doesn't represent the city I used to call home

London is a city of kindness, generosity, equality & love

This sign represents the opposite

We must always call out this form of ignorance & intolerance - I am glad so many are

Just like my <a href="../Articles/UBC_SJI_BeckiRoss.html">article</a> on UBC "Social Justice Institute," teacher Becki Ross, I've noticed that these people have this really weird disdain for proper punctuation and grammar. Now that I've seen it, I can't unsee it. I took a look through this dude's twitter, and I couldn't help but notice that his tweets either had all the periods or none of them. I've never seen this before, someone who can write properly, yet struggles to remember his periods. 

Anyway, I clicked on the link to the CBC article, reading it so that you don't have to, and my god. I'm not going to quote all of it, just this relevant part.

Jina Zhang, who has lived in London for 10 years, said using the term "China virus" is anti-Asian and hateful toward the minority group in the community.

"We are angry," Zhang said, noting that she's always felt safe in the city, until now. 

Ben Cai, a student at Western University, echoed those concerns, calling the sign a direct attack on the Asian community.

"[It] makes Asian people feel uncomfortable and worried and concerned about our own safety," said Cai, who is Chinese.

He said using the term "China virus" is racist and lays blame on a minority group for the COVID-19 pandemic. 

CBC News tried to contact the owner of the Ale House on Thursday by visiting the establishment, calling and sending emails, but was unable to reach anyone for comment. 

Alexandra Kane, lead activist with Black Lives Matter London, said the city's No. 1 priority should be to immediately take the message down.

Kane said after coming across a post on social media calling for its removal, she was prompted to reach out to the chief of police, the chair of the London Police Board chairs and city councillors.

Translation: Stasi Agent who works for multi-billion dollar propaganda outlet tracks down small business owner to terrorize them, threaten their livelihood with legal action, and implicitly threaten them with violence, and loss of business. 

But the real oppressor is the small business owner. And the real victims are the random Asians who cooperated with the billion dollar propaganda outlet that has the implicit backing of the entire Corporate-State Complex.

For the record, the actual Police of London have already stated that they won't be pursuing any legal action, because no laws have been broken. Don't give the cops props for not oppressing you, but I do feel the need to correct the "here's my excuse for not doing real life action," types who want to pretend that the cops will always shoot you the second you leave your door.
