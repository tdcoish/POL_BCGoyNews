Award-winning filmmaker Michelle Latimer's Indigenous identity under scrutiny
TDC_ARTICLE_STOP
This is gonna be a real good article, goy. Pack some popcorn, because this gets pretty hilarious.
TDC_ARTICLE_START
An acclaimed film director lauded for two high-profile Indigenous productions this year says she's sorry for not verifying her ties to an Algonquin community after facing questions over the validity of her identity.

Michelle Latimer, who recently directed the CBC television series Trickster and the documentary Inconvenient Indian, has risen to become one of Canada's most prominent names in Indigenous filmmaking. 

However, Latimer's long-standing claim of Indigenous identity is facing scrutiny after she claimed to be of "Algonquin, Métis and French heritage, from Kitigan Zibi Anishinabeg (Maniwaki), Que." in an Aug. 14 National Film Board (NFB) news release.

The claim caught the attention of Kitigan Zibi members who began questioning her family connection to the community, which is located about 120 kilometres north of Ottawa. 

While Latimer believes she has a legitimate connection, she now says she made a mistake and should not have claimed that connection before she had the research to back up the link to the Algonquin First Nation. 

"I sincerely apologize for naming the community of Kitigan Zibi publicly before I had done all of the necessary work to understand the connection," said Latimer, in an emailed statement to CBC News. A similar statement was issued publicly on Thursday through Facebook.

Wow, I'm genuinely shocked to see that this lady is not actually an Abo. I mean my level of shock goes beyond describeable. I mean, they could have taken a look at her and figured out that she's a White Woman, but that might have been discriminatory or something?
Also, check out this hilarious search I got on DuckDuckGo.

Yeah, I mean these people are getting harder and harder to parody with every passing day.

As far as the article goes, I'm going to skip over the sort of unraveling of her lies, since it's not that interesting.

Ancestral link vs. Indigenous identity
Kim TallBear, an associate professor of Native studies at the University of Alberta, said Indigenous identity claims based on a vague ancestral link are common in Canada and the U.S. 

TallBear said some of these claims are not willfully malicious, but based on a misunderstanding that race and Indigenous identity are the same thing. 

"There is a difference between race and being a member of Indigenous Peoples," said TallBear, who is an enrolled member of the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate, which is part of the Dakota Nation.

"I don't think they are willfully lying. They don't understand what they don't know."

TallBear said these types of claims do pose a threat to Indigenous peoples and communities because they undermine the political and territorial underpinnings of Indigenous identity.

"The colonizer wants genetic ancestry alone to stand in for what counts as Indigenous — well that's to their benefit. It helps disappear us in terms of being living communities that makes demands on resources, that makes demands for treaties to be upheld," said TallBear.

"If Indigenous people were just nothing more than some genetic ancestor long ago, that would leave them off the hook for the obligations they owe to Indigenous peoples."

Wew. Lots to unpack here. First, imagine thinking that someone named Kim Tallbear has a right to teach in our Universities, whilst bitching about our imaginary "obligations owed to Indigenous peoples." Second though, I do agree with her as to how ridiculous it is that someone with 1/32nd whatever ancestry claims to be a part of that tribe. That's not how societies work. Harvey Weinstein probably has some White ancestry, that doesn't make him White.

I for one applaud Kim Tallbear for bringing to light the issue of Jews who have tiny amounts of White Ancestry claiming to be White. As a fellow Jew, I feel that us jews have contributed to the undermining of political and territorial underpinnings of White Identity. For this, on behalf of all Jews, I am deeply sorry.

Kitigan Zibi members have not been the only ones to question Latimer's claims. Mi'kmaw filmmaker Jeff Barnaby said he began hearing rumours questioning Latimer's identity over the past summer and began looking into it himself. 
<img src="../Images/jeffBarnaby2.jpg"><figcaption>Jeff Barnaby</figcaption>
"If she is Native, then she is from somewhere … Anyone who wants to represent a Native community has to hail from a Native community," said Barnaby. 

Barnaby, who recently directed the film Blood Quantum and received acclaim for his film Rhyme for Young Ghouls, said if the evidence shows Latimer is not Indigenous, then it is an indictment on the film industry. 

"They cannot seem to tell the difference between authentic representation and some white lady striking poses."

I mean it's hard to have any commentary other than a chuckle. Yeah, no shit. "Aboriginal Culture," to the extent it ever was something deep and meaningful, has been reduced to such a cartoon parody that some White Woman waving her arms about gets taken seriously as a true member of whatever dumbfuck tribe that's filled with people 80% White living off welfare. And the most fucked up thing is that at this point I'm not even sure that they're wrong. Some White Woman muttering "hey how are ya hey how are ya" as she bangs some shitty instrument in the Abo version of Chopin or Beethoven is pretty much where Big Chief Ooohaha is in the year 2020.

Barnaby said he raised his concerns about Latimer's Indigenous identity claims in an email on Aug. 12 to Jesse Wente, board chair of the Canada Council for the Arts and executive director of the Indigenous Screen Office.

I included this so you would know that there's something called the Indigenous Screen Office. Also, that the board char of the Canada Council for the Arts is an Abo. Also, that his name is Jesse and he looks as White as me.

Over the last decade, Latimer has amassed a large number of awards, grants and fellowships recognizing her work at raising awareness of Indigenous rights and sovereignty.

This year, she won awards from the Toronto International Film Festival and a grant from Fork Films for a documentary on Mi'kmaw activist Annie Mae Aquash who was murdered while a member of the American Indian Movement. 

Latimer also recently won Canada's DOC Institute's BMO-DOC Vanguard Award which included $40,000 in in-kind production services and a $1,000 cash prize and the Sundance Institute Screenwriting Labs's Chicken & Egg Breakthrough Award.

Yeah, she's pushed the Globo Homo Schlomo Anti-White Narrative, which is why she won those awards. It's also why nobody gave a single fuck that she's obviously a White Woman, because she's just an employee of theirs. Then some Abo named Jeff Barnaby didn't understand the shot, or just wanted to take her down a peg, so now the CBC and these Anti-Whites have a little egg on their faces. 

Remember, they actually want White People to be in these roles, because then they get competence. However bad Latimer's filmmaking really was, it's probably better than whatever actual Abos can do, which is why they want her and not them.

And as for the Bank of Montreal giving her awards. Well...

Oh but wait goy, I forgot the absolute best part of this piece. It was written by two authors, a Jorge Barrera, a migrant from Spain, and one, I shit you not, Ka’nhehsí:io Deer. Well, that last name sure sound like a real Feather Indian name. So let's take a look at our picture of, uh, Ka'nhehsi:io.

So the author of a "White Woman secretly pretending to be Abo" propaganda piece looks like this. Interesting. I find this interesting. Let's take another look at "Kahneshoi" or whatever the fuck her fake name is.

My name is Jessica Deer and I am a Cinema, Video and Communications student at Dawson College. My life consists of doodling, playing music and watching films. This past year, I became deeply interested in journalism.
If you were wondering about my URL, my Mohawk name is Ka’nhehsi:io, which means “fine silk.”

Yeah she seems like a lowlife crossed with a nutter. And in fact, she only recently switched from Jessica Deer, to Ka'hneshiio, or whatever I'm not going to fucking spellcheck that shit every time.

Call me Ka'nhehsí:io: Why I'm reclaiming my Kanien'kéha name

I was named Ka'nhehsí:io by my Tóta.

My chubby cheeks and soft blond hair reminded my grandmother of a Cabbage Patch Kid. In the mid-1980s, the must-have toy launched a new line of dolls with nylon hair that could be combed rather than the standard yarn hair.

I've always preferred to be called Ka'nhehsí:io but for the majority of my journalism career, I've used my English name, Jessica. It was easier. No one struggles to spell it or pronounce it and there's never any bureaucratic hassles when you share a name with thousands of other women born between the late 1980s and early 1990s.

That's it. We officially have people who are MORE White than me pretending to be Abos. Is this a fucking parody or something? Reading this propaganda is like some sort of out of body experience for me.
