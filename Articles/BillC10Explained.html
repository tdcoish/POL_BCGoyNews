Those of you who have been mildly following Canadian Politics may have come across Bill C-10. This is a bill, proposed by the Finkle-Left Liberal Party, which they claim to be about expanding the Canadian Cultural Producers and something something sticking it to American Tech Corporations. No, it doesn't involve stopping them from censoring Canadians online, you silly goy. A relatively apolitical criticism of the bill can be found here.

Having spent a month dissecting the bill, it will come as no surprise that I believe the bill is deeply flawed. My concerns involve six main issues: Canadian Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault’s inaccurate descriptions of the bill and its impact, the negative effects on longstanding Canadian broadcast policy, the extensive regulatory approach, the uncertainty that comes from leaving key issues to the CRTC or a secretive policy direction, the questionable data underlying the policy, and its outlier approach compared to peer countries.

First, with all due respect, Minister Guilbeault has consistently made questionable claims about the content of the bill and how it compares to other jurisdictions. He told the House of Commons that the bill contains economic thresholds (it doesn’t), that it excludes news (it doesn’t), that it won’t affect Canadian ownership requirements (it will), that the entire process will be completed by next year (it won’t), and that it is similar to the approach implemented in Europe (it isn’t). These are not inconsequential misstatements. If Canadians are to engage in a reasoned debate about the bill, it should be based on fact, not creative or misleading interpretations of the proposal.

You know that legislation is bad, when despite these people controlling the media through direct bribery, they still have to lie. Because they can't just tell you what's in the bill, because it would be so unpopular. 

Ironic, that the people who are really concerned about "misinformation," are... deliberate misinformers.

Second, while the Guilbeault trumpets the benefits that come from mandated payments to support Canadian content production (a benefit he massively exaggerates), he fails to acknowledge that this comes at a great cost. Longstanding Canadian bedrock broadcast policies such as Canadian ownership and control of the broadcasting system, removal of policy objectives to make “maximum use” of Canadian creative talent, and the prioritization of Canadian intellectual property are not policies that should simply be discarded when they prove inconvenient to fulfilling promises to “get money from web giants.” Yet that is precisely what Bill C-10 does without even mention of it in the briefing materials.

Again, I would stress that this bill does not stop non-Canadian Trillion Dollar Tech Conglomerates from censoring Canadians online. So this laughably fake psuedo-populist position the Liberals of all parties are taking about "taking the fight to YouTube," or whatever is just that, laughable. 

But on a frankly humourous note, this is a Globalist policy if ever there was one. The purpose of this policy is to actually destroy Canadians rights to media. While the CBC doesn't represent average Canadians of course, neither do foreign propaganda outlets. This bill amazingly drops literally the very first policy from our Broadcasting Act. After this bill, the Canadian broadcasting system will no longer be owned or operated by Canadians. This is truly amazing, and as expected, you have to go to obscure areas of the internet to get a real overview of this anti-Canadian policy.

Again, this part doesn't really matter that much. These institutions are anti-democratic, anti-White, and frankly even anti-Canadian, to the extent that is a meaningful identity. But now they have to directly compete against (((Disney))), (((Netflix))), and whatever International corporation there is, that doesn't even pretend to have ties to Canada. So I mean it's a fight between Globo Homo Schlomo, and a different faction of Globo Homo Schlomo.

Third, the government’s claims that the bill does not license Internet services is deceptive in the extreme. The regulatory framework that Bill C-10 establishes is – as Andrew Coyne described it – “one of the most radical expansions of state regulation in Canadian history.” The regulatory framework that includes mandated registration, a host of conditions of operation, mandated payments, discoverability requirements, mandatory disclosure of detailed confidential information including algorithmic data, and the prospect of multi-million dollar penalties for failure to comply is an enormous regulatory edifice that will invariably lead many services to block the Canadian market altogether. Indeed, when Guilbeault says that the government is not determining what Canadians can watch, he fails to address the risk that his policies will reduce consumer choice and eliminate legal access to many services.

Let me explain this a little bit more. All of these impositions are impositions on "online undertakings," which they claim is literally anyone who makes money off of Canadians. So if you have a patreon account and a single Canadian is subscribed, you now bear the massive brunt of these impositions, and can be legally fucked with by the government constantly, including good old fashioned shakedowns.

In fact, it is actually worse than that. If you aren't getting paid directly, you don't have to hop through these legal hoops. However, your individual posts to Youtube, or TikTok, or Twitter, are still regulated by this. So the Canadian government can censor you by making these corporations censor you, and provides an incentive for even more censorship by them online.

Of course, we are already censored, so meh.

But the reason they want "algorithmic data," appears to be taking over the YouTube/Twitter algorithm which suggests content. They claim this is to promote "Diverse Canadian Content Creators." Basically it's to push anti-White content creators and content itself, as well as try desperately to get more eyeballs on their official channels. 

Remember, they're fine with these corporations censoring Canadians, that's not the issue here.

Fourth, for a bill that was months in the making, it is remarkable how many issues are left either to the CRTC to decide or will be part of a policy direction to the regulator that remains a secret and that will not be subject to public debate or scrutiny. Bill C-10 is a bill that leaves more questions than answers: who is subject to regulation and who is exempt, what regulation, how much to be paid, how to meet discoverability requirements, what confidential data to provide, and what counts as Canadian content are all issues left for another day. Indeed, the bill is the ultimate “trust us” with Canadians and all stakeholders denied access to the level of detail most would require to make reasonable business decisions (hence the concern that the bill will lead to less production in Canada in the short term).

I'm sure that they won't abuse said ambiguity to oppress White People.

TL:DR: Mass power grab by Finkel-Leftists. Yes, they will use this for censorship. Yes, the bill is amiguous. Yes, they have been caught lying about it. Yes, they want to use this to silence White People and artificially promote brown people. Yes, this applies to everything you post online. 

No, they don't care about these corporations censoring Canadians, in fact they love it. There's nothing in this for you.
