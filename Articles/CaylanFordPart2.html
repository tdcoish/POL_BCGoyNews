In <a href="../Articles/CaylanFordPart1.html">Part 1,</a> I gave you the backstory behind Caylan Ford. To sum it all up, she was a rising star in the United Conservative Party, who got shitcanned by the Donor Class, through Jason Kenney of the UCP, PressProgress, the NDP and the CBC.

However, that was a year and a half ago, almost two years ago. Just a few days ago, she filed a lawsuit against those that had wronged her. I'm going to be covering this both from a legal perspective, at least to the best extent I can, and a political perspective.

To start, I'm going to reference a post she made on her website, <a href="https://www.caylanford.com/blog-1/2020/11/16/on-fighting-back-against-cancel-culture">Caylanford.com:</a>

A year and a half ago, I was on my way to winning a seat in the Alberta legislature. Today, thanks to a concerted campaign of defamation by the New Democratic Party and its allies, I am borderline unemployable.

In Alberta’s 2019 provincial election, I was one of the faces of my party. I was a young mother, a former advisor at the Canadian foreign ministry, an award-winning documentary filmmaker, and an Oxford-educated international human rights advocate. I was featured prominently in campaign ads and was described as part of the next generation of conservative leadership. Although I was running in a swing seat—my main opponent was the NDP’s then-justice minister—our polling showed that I was on track to win.

In one sense, one could say "Live by the sword, die by the sword." This, in reference to Caylan Ford not really being one of us. I do not have a masters degree in history, like Mrs. Ford. I am not an award-winning documentary filmmaker, nor do I think any documentaries I would be interested in making would win any awards. Not with the awards crowd at least. I am not Oxford-educated, nor am I an "international human rights advocate." I do not have an in with the United Conservative Party, or any other Donor Funded Party. 

So why am I defending Caylan Ford? Well, in part because she serves as a lesson to any who think there is anything to be gained with "good optics," or "infiltrating Donor-Right Party," or any other cowardly idiocy promoted in many cases by outright grifters, or well-meaning dupes. Caylan Ford is a great example, precisely because she is not one of us, and yet she still was targeted, while she would never say this, because she is a Good-Hearted White Woman, who would ultimately, when in Congress, act how she felt best for the people of the province of Alberta. It was for that she was destroyed.

Then, less than a month before election day, an NDP-affiliated website published an anonymous claim that I had “echoed white nationalist rhetoric” in a private conversation years earlier. Before I could respond, the NDP issued a press release demanding that I be removed from the ballot. 

Prominent politicians and journalists didn’t hesitate before piling on. They denounced me as “vile” and “abhorrent,” and demanded that I confess and apologize for beliefs I have never held. They wrote that I had “promoted white supremacy,” made “hateful” social media posts, and had complained about supposed unfairness towards white supremacist terrorists. I hadn’t actually done any of these things, but the force and endless repetition of the accusations almost convinced me that I had.

And this yet again shows the limitations of working within the system. Those who are promoted by the propagandists, will be destroyed by the propagandists. If the local media calls you on for an interview, I am not saying that you shouldn't take it, because you have the opportunity to speak. As the purpose is to spread your message, there is nothing wrong with this.

However, who writes their cheques? Do you? If not, understand that if their owners decide that you need to be slandered and destroyed, the dutiful mouthpieces will snap into line, and any personal relationship you might have once thought you had will be destroyed.

After all, that's what these people are paid to do.

A “trial by media” is a misnomer: it is not a search for truth or justice, and there is no semblance of due process. The crimes are never clearly defined. There is no presumption of innocence, no rules of evidence, no concern for fairness or proportionality. If a person is condemned on the basis of allegations that turn out to be false, incomplete, or misleading, there is no authority to whom they can appeal for redress. 

Within four hours, my candidacy was over. The NDP would go on to win the seat. My life, meanwhile, was irrevocably changed.

Confirmation. The only proper response to an attack by these propagandists is dismissal. "Oh look goyim, the people who lied us into Iraq and Afghanistan are lying about me again. You should take this VERY seriously." Defense should not even be considered an option. The only way forward is to attack.

Friends faced pressure to denounce me, or else risk being judged guilty to association. Some who stood by me were harassed and accused of “supporting a white supremacist.” The one radio show that gave me a platform to defend myself faced a boycott campaign. Several journalists and editors told me that they knew narrative about me was false, but they were afraid to say anything, lest they be targeted too.

Of course, in many cases that's an excuse given by those who support what's being done to you, yet want plausible deniability. But even still, I feel for Caylan. After all, why did Caylan Ford get into politics? Do you think she ran for MP because she had no other employment opportunities? That's absurd, she had a degree from Oxford and was an award-winning documentarian. Do you think she got in this because of some finanacial scheme, or run of the mill corruption? If that were true, she would have been a lot less naive, and a lot less trusting of the snakes around her.

I will feel for Caylan, because, while she's not our girl, she represents the spirit of a genuine and wonderful woman, who wanted to make a positive difference in the world, and was destroyed by this as a result. And I'm not going to tolerate any constantly online spergs who want to countersignal this. 

Normal people do not have a well formed understanding of the world, and that is by design. They can't name for you the 10 largest donors to Jason Kenney. In many cases, they can't really tell you what's wrong with the world. But they can tell you wrong from right if it's shoved in front of their faces.

Having said all that, we need to learn from the Caylan Ford's of the world. The first and most important thing is what I stated off earlier, laugh off the accusations and counterattack the propagandists. Second, do not give in, and in fact use the accusations as proof of your moral righteousness. This is in fact correct. Those attacking your are in league, or, in many cases, the exact same Mass Murder Propagandits who lied us into Iraq and Afghanistan.

Think of David Frum's smirking face before you respond to any attack from these people as genuine. You are being attacked by those who sqeal with joy at the murders of Palestinian Children. Those who support 11 year old girls being sexualized on camera. Those who lie to the filthy goy-peasants about all manner of things big and small, from the murder of Jeffrey Epstein, to the supposed fluidity of human sexuality. 

But fighting back must be more than rhetoric. And in fact, Caylan is not as helpless as she would seem.

I also believe in consequences and accountability. 

I think there should be consequences for people who wield career- and potentially life-destroying accusations frivolously and dishonestly for their own advantage. There should be consequences for deepening ideological polarization, and for eroding our capacity for openness and honest dialogue. 

I am sometimes asked what we can do to fight back against cancel culture. One answer is that we can each try to uphold human virtues—real virtues, not the performative ones. We can commit ourselves to seeking truth, and refuse to give in to anger or assent to lies. We can be courageous in the defence of our friends. We can be slow to judge, and generous and humble when we do.  

We can also impose costs on those who use these tactics—not by playing their socially destructive game, subjecting them to retributive humiliation, or unleashing a mob against them—but by holding them accountable for their actions under the law. 

That is what I’m doing by filing a $7-million defamation claim against the NDP, Press Progress, the CBC, the Toronto Star, and others. I am not asking for sympathy or looking for revenge: unlike my accusers, I am simply interested in the truth.

A mixed bag, no doubt. We can see here the Conservative Temperment in full effect. Caylan Ford can be thought of as someone who fully bought in to Donor-Right Narratives, but was disappointed that they never turned into anything. Very similar to Maxime Bernier, as another example. These people are not just going to say "yeah LOL, fuck these propagandists, you can kiss my ass." That would after all, be impolite. 

Maybe I'm being unfair. Some people aren't motivated by looking down at us lowly peasants. They are simply conflict-averse, and want to think the best of others. These people do not belong in politics, precisely because they are genuinely good people. 

However, she did at least file a 7-million dollar lawsuit. I've run out of space to cover that today, so I'll be working my way through the details of that tomorrow.
