'Perverse logic​': Don't compare the flu to COVID-19
TDC_ARTICLE_STOP
Prepare thine jimmies goy, we're going to be in for a real long string of gaslighting.

TORONTO -- Since early in the COVID-19 pandemic, social media has been overrun with confusion and misinformation.

Conspiracy theorists and pseudoscientists have peddled claims that the novel coronavirus is a bioweapon, or caused by cellular networks or that injecting disinfectant was a viable treatment — none of which are true.

Among the myriad of misguided messages online, some widely shared posts claim that the virus has a lower death rate than the seasonal flu, even though influenza immunization is widely available and there’s no vaccine for COVID-19 yet.

“You don’t have to build temporary morgues during influenza season,” said Laura Rosella, Canada Research Chair in Population Health Analytics, in a phone interview with CTVNews.ca. “In influenza season we do not see an overwhelming of the ICUs that we saw in (Italy), Brazil, Spain and France. These things just don’t add up.”

Oh yeah I'm just knee deep in carcasses over here while shopping for my organic kale here at Whole Foods. People just coofing and then keeling over. It's really unhygenic and I wish they would stop that. 

I mean there's just carcasses piled up for days in the parking lot. We could definitely use a couple of morgues on wheels over here to sweep these cadavers up. I don't think it's good for tourism to let this continue to happen.

Despite an overwhelming body of evidence to disprove such social media statements, the mistruths persist, perhaps because of something called dezinformatsiya, a Russian word for “disinformation,” said David Fisman, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto.

Yeah I heard that Vladimir Putin has elite haxorrrrrred the mainframe hull schematics of Facebook. It's only natural that, as a result, the peasants might stop believing the propagandists who lied us into Iraq and Afghanistan when they tell us the truth and nothing but the truth over the new Bubonic Plague, COVID. AKA, the Waifu Flu.

“I don't think this is misunderstanding or something that's correctable by confronting people with facts,” he told CTVNews.ca in an email. “It is designed to sow confusion and disrupt public health responses.”

And whether it is or isn't, he definitely won't try. Because facts have a distinctly pro-Fascism bias. Facts are pretty much Neo-Nazis at this point.

Influenza is raised routinely in conversations about COVID-19, particularly among online groups that also spread misinformation about vaccinations. One post in particular has gained traction online in recent weeks, quoting someone named Bryan Matti as saying: “The COVID-19 death rate without a vaccine is lower than the flu death rate with a vaccine.” The quote appears to be from a May 7 tweet by Matti, a Twitter user who identifies as a Detroit-based “Make America Great Again” supporter, a “truth seeker” and a “conspiracy realist.” He does not appear to be any type of health-care professional.

The statement is not only inaccurate, but lacks clarity, said Rosella. “With a general statement like that it’s hard to know exactly what it means,” she said. “The real challenge here is the denominator.”

Is the claim based on measuring how many people die among a group of infected people? Is it measuring the death rate among the general population? Either way, it’s “comparing apples and oranges,” said University of Waterloo’s Chris Bauch, a specialist in mathematical and computer modelling of infectious disease outbreaks.

“We’ve pulled all the stops to prevent COVID,” he said. “The only reason it’s not killing more people is because we’re stopping it.”

I had no idea there was such thing as someone who "is a specialist in mathematical and computer modelling of infectious disease outbreaks," but I have to say, he's definitely living his best life. 

Your goy brain may notice that they never actually get around to giving you any quantified explanation for why the goy they're slandering is actually, you know, factually incorrect. But remember goy, this isn't something that can be addressed with facts, according to the Jew David Fisman.

What follows is a long tedious section that you don't need to read, wherein they contort themselves into pretzels trying to explain why this outbreak is in fact, despite all evidence to the contrary, not just the flu.

THE ‘PREVENTION PARADOX’

Using a population denominator, the COVID-19 death rate in Canada as of June 25 was 23 people per 100,000 population, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada. The influenza death rate is typically between nine and 13 per 100,000 population, depending on the severity of the flu strains in a particular season.

To compare the two is not a valuable measure since lockdown efforts have likely slowed the COVID-19 infection rate dramatically and saved lives, said Rosella.

Flu seasons are not met with school closures and travel restrictions. Schools remain open, long-term care facilities aren’t shutting out visitors and airports are operating at full-tilt. There’s a vaccine, but only 42 per cent of Canadians got the flu shot in the 2018-2019 season, according to Statistics Canada.

“We can’t say, ‘We’ve prevented thousands of COVID cases but the mortality rate is lower.’ You can’t compare them,” said Rosella. “You’re comparing a situation where we have (taken) unprecedented steps to control infection to a situation where we don’t.”

To believe otherwise is a “perverse logic,” said Bauch, explaining its role in a so-called “prevention paradox.”

“It’s this psychology that we don’t appreciate preventive interventions, because if they’re successful the thing they prevent never comes to pass. For example, vaccines prevent infections, therefore if vaccines are successful you never see the conditions they’re intended to prevent. So in countries with high vaccine coverage, some people say ‘Why should I vaccinate? There’s no infection here,’” he said. The lockdown measures during the COVID-19 pandemic may be revealing that paradox.

So all that can be accurately summed up as "we've got less infections than the regular flu, and less deaths." Everything else is midwitisms designed to obfuscate. 

This next part is a real treat though.

CASE FATALITY ‘MUCH HIGHER’

Since Canada has implemented major interventions during the pandemic, the better number to use is the mortality rate among infected people, said Bauch. Those numbers show that the coronavirus is worse too.

The case fatality rate “is very clearly much higher for COVID than for influenza by a factor of 10 or so,” he said.

The case fatality rate (CFR) for the seasonal flu is typically cited at about 0.1 per cent or less. For COVID-19, the case fatality rate is estimated to be at least 1.0 per cent, but has been as high as 31.4 in the northern Italy. New research published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal estimated that the CFR for COVID-19 in Canada was 1.6 per cent near the end of April after adjusting for low reporting rates.

A 31.4% death rate in Northern Italy eh? Kinda weird that they included that, since it shows how completely full of shit they are. Oh yeah, Northern Italy had an estimated death rate of 31.4%, literally 20x higher than what we claim, but we're going to throw that in here because it's a big number.

And as for "well, the actual fatality rate is too low for us to tell you, but if we just pretend that there are massive amounts of people dying of COVID who never get reported, then it's like at least 10x more deadly than the flu."

I tell you, this really is some fourth string propaganda.

Next part can be skimmed.

DEATH TALLYING DIFFERENCE

Comparing the number of deaths isn’t appropriate either, experts say, because the way deaths are counted for each illness differs. 

Since March 9, a massive health surveillance system of testing and documentation has recorded more than 8,500 deaths COVID-19 in Canada.

Conversely, about 3,500 Canadians die from influenza every year, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada. But during flu season, health officials use data modelling to form an estimate of the number of influenza deaths. The number is often coupled with deaths from pneumonia, a common result of the flu, into a single “P&I” number. Between 2014 and 2018, pneumonia and influenza caused between 6,235 and 8,511 deaths annually, according to Statistics Canada.

But some pneumonia deaths can be attributed to other causes beyond influenza, including bacterial infection and now COVID-19, said Bauch.

“If there’s a death and the doctor notes that the cause is pneumonia, then with or without an influenza test confirmation, they’ll just say this is a pneumonia and influenza death,” he said. “If a patient never got tested for COVID and they die, they may get lumped into that category too.”
TDC_ARTICLE_STOP
Oh good god, this is so unscientific. First, let me explain to you goy. No shit they lump in peneumonia deaths with confirmed flu deaths. Pneumonia is an inflamation or serious infection of the lungs. If you get the flu, you will almost certainly get some type of pneumonia. Having a random virus doesn't kill you, the symptoms kill you. Lots of children have their hearts stop when they get the flu, because they have trouble breathing, and go into cardiac arrest. This is how the flu kills you. So unless this propagandist is suggesting that, for no reason at all, this year 100% of pneumonia deaths are not the flu, then he needs to explain how exactly that could be possible.

But you know what, I'm trying to bring facts and logic into an article written by a guy who looks like this.

Besides, scientists have already discovered a way to become totally immune to COVID. You simply attend a BLM loot trip, or an Antifa riot, and you are completely immune.

The propaganda piece continues, but I think I've gotten my point across.
