PSA:
This is apropos of nothing, but it’s important to understand the <a href="https://truthtopowernews.com/media-criticism/finkle-think-how-jews-successfully-manipulate-masses-including-dissidents-who-should">Finkelthink</a> over the whole “Defund the Police, they evil White People,” versus the “No, Blue Lives Matter, cops are great, blah blah blah.” It’s so fucking tiresome seeing people fall into a trap like this, so let me speedrun the explanation for why this is all bullshit.

Gun control is one of the biggest issues of “the left,” an improper term for what is really just the social arm of Globo Homo Schlomo. It’s really important to these people to ensure that you are disarmed. This, unlike the actually popular economic policies they pretend to give a shit about, often leads into tangible policy, and only grassroots organizations such as the NRA have stopped them from being completely successful in America. Here in Canada, they’ve gotten almost everything they want.

They also pretend to be really against the cops, even going so far as to pretend to seriously call for them to be defunded. And yet, it doesn’t seem very important to these people to have the cops disarmed. Remember, they want you disarmed. They don’t want you to be able to walk around with a gun. But they’re totally fine with the cops walking around heavily armed. They’re totally cool with that. 

I don’t want to see anyone in our movement getting caught up in Finkelthink. Globo Homo Schlomo loves the cops. They absolutely fucking love them, and they know that if they ever passed gun control for cops, in a week the peasants would have them overthrown, and their heads would be on sticks. The cops are what protect Tranny Story Time from the peasants. The cops are who enforce Anti-White racial discrimination at universities. The cops are who will go to your house and shoot you for fact checking the Lampshade-o-caust. The cops protect Jeff Bezos’s stolen wealth from you. The cops exist to enforce the system that oppresses you, and the people who are “super duper seriously” calling for the cops to be defunded, actually love the Cops.

They will never call for disarmament of the Pension Seekers in Blue, because if they were to call for the cops to be disarmed, that would be really popular. In fact, I think that I might make that a policy plank. That the cops are not allowed to have more weaponry than the peasants. If they’re allowed to walk around with pistols, then so should we. And if “the left,” which remember is just the social arm of Globo Homo Schlomo, ever called for policies like this, it would be a propaganda black eye, because the first thing people would think is “yeah, now that I think about it, it’s sort of weird how important disarming me was to these people, but not the cops that they hate.” So it would be popular, it would be against their interests (since the cops work for them), and it would make them unpopular. 

Instead, they try to have their cake and eat it too. Since everybody under the age of 40 and with a brain fucking hates the cops, they want to channel that dangerous sentiment into “the cops are bad because they are meanies to black crack dealers and you should be sad.” Then they get Antifa, a mix of the sons and daughters of the privileged and outright meth addicts, to go out and LARP around like their revolutionaries calling for the abolishment of the Pension Seekers in Blue, along with a bunch of Jequeerus’s having a chimpout in the middle of looting a Target. The sentiment of “fuck these cops,” is a really dangerous sentiment for you peasants to have, so they hopefully want to channel that for their ends, or at least to a place that goes nowhere. Absolute disaster for them would be to have the “fuck the police,” sentiment be monopolized by goyim with good hearts.

I don’t want to get sidetracked, but it’s the same exact shit that they try to pull with “anti-capitalism.” The sentiment of “fuck Jeff Bezos,” is really popular amongst the peasants. And any policies that would arise from that non-ideological and therefore real sentiment would be extremely threatening for the ruling class. That’s why you see Antifa faggots talking about how “Capitalism is bad because it oppresses black trans folk.” They’d like to take “Fuck Mark Zuckerberg,” or “I’d like better wages and more vacation time,” and turn that into you not getting that, but them turning your goy child into a tranny. But ultimately, they're fine with that sentiment just not going anywhere.

The same is true for Cuckservatism. The sentiments of “I’m tired of this anti-white racial discrimination,” or “Diagnosing an orphaned two year old child with ‘gender dysphoria’ is child abuse,” are really dangerous. Those are some naughty thoughts you’re having, goy. The purpose of cuckservatism is to turn those natural sentiments into Wars for Israel and Billionaires getting everything they want. People have complained about Cuckservatives running awful campaigns, especially here in Canada, but ultimately their donors are perfectly happy to settle for white people not getting a reprieve from Anti-Whitism and HIV positive homosexual Child Abusers being allowed to abuse orphaned children. They’re fine with simply not letting you get what you want, in the same way that billionaires are fine with “fuck Jeff Bezos,” simply going nowhere.

But to get back to the “wah, cops are wacist,” versus “cops are the thin blue line blah blah,” this is a great example of Finkelthink. And so are the above. The point is to ensure that you get depoliticized, and any effort you expel politically is going to go into a completely absurd ridiculous venture, that furthers the goals of your enemies. 

Friends don’t let friends get finkelthinked.
