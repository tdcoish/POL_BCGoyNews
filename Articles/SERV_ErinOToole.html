Well, he's the current Cuck Leader, and if you don't want Globo Homo Schlomo, you're supposed to be getting really excited about voting for this little manlet. So, let's allow Erin O'Toole to introduce himself.

You know, before I actually get into the article, I need to share with you a screenshot, so you know what the general page layout of his site is.

Yeah so it's basically homosexuality. This isn't even the worse part, either in terms of text, or imagery. Also, there's this hilariously stupid little animated helicopter in the middle of the page. You can't see it in the still shot, but the tail rotor is animated. It's not responsive, it just always spins around. It's basically something straight out of "HTML for dummies," with one foot in the "How to add Pizazz to a random webpage!" Corporate World.

I mean techincally Erin hasn't become the PM yet. Then again, Erin will never be the PM, so I think this still works.

This is the story of how Erin went from flying on Royal Canadian Air Force Choppers to Parliament.

For some reason the following is not just pornographic scene after pornographic scene of Erin O'Toole sucking one donors cock after another. I mean come on Erin, we all know that's what happened, don't infantalize us.

Roots in the Manufacturing Town of Bowmanville
Erin O’Toole, the eldest of five, was born in Montreal in 1973. His Dad worked for General Motors and his Mom studied to become a teacher.

A transfer took the family to Bowmanville, Ontario where Erin grew up.

When he was nine, Erin tragically lost his mother to breast cancer. It was this experience that taught him the importance of making the best of what you’ve got and who you are, and to never give anything less than your all.

Erin’s father remarried and they taught their five children to work hard, help your neighbour and care deeply about your community and country.

Jesus Christ Erin. I know that your mother for you died 30 years ago, but for me her death was the last sentence. You can't have literally the next sentence be "but here's how her death was awesome because it made me the man I am today!" It's jarring. It's also so obvious that whomever wrote this was happy that Mommy got the axe, because I guess they thought it might make Erin "Suck Cock or Die Tryin'" O'Toole personable and sympathetic or something.

I swear to fucking god, I could make so much money being the ghostwriter for these shills. I wouldn't do it. But if I did do it, I would do it so much better.

For the record, the way it's supposed to be written is: "Erin's mom died when he was 5. Words. Lots of words. Tons more words. Erin's early hardships taught him the value of perseverence and discipline." That way it's more subtle, and not "Mom Died -> My Personality Upgraded".

12 Years of Military Service
Erin enrolled in the Royal Military College of Canada at 18 and became an officer for the Royal Canadian Air Force at 22. He did basic training in Chilliwack, got his wings in Winnipeg and was then based in Shearwater, Nova Scotia.

Erin then spent his twenties flying on search and rescue missions and naval support operations with 423 Squadron.

He rose the military ranks to Captain and was awarded both the Canadian Forces Decoration and the Sikorsky Helicopter Rescue Award for rescuing an injured fisherman at sea.

Erin’s military service instilled him with the determination to always see a mission through.

So I did some research into this. Erin's job was "Air Navigator," a role mostly destroyed in the civilian sector all the way back in the 80's, a full decade before The Toole got his hands on your taxes. Apparently, GPS is magically not effective in the military, or something, and so he got to sit in the side of a fucking helicopter twiddling his thumbs like a Dinkus, doing glorified Coast Guard work. I mean, Coast Guard work is good and all, but this queer was never deployed overseas. He was never in a combat role, or an ancilliary role that could have gotten him killed.

He did the military equivalent of a helicopter ride along for 12 fucking years and collected a very generous cheque and pension. So think about that next time you hear him do his "muh service." This little queer had one of the cushiest jobs in all the land.

A Classic Canadian Love Story
It was at a Mooseheads game in Halifax that Erin met Rebecca in 1998. 

Rebecca was his last first date. They’ve been at each other's side ever since and now celebrate over twenty years of marriage and have two children, Mollie and Jack.

At least his wife seems nice. Even in his wedding picture, Erin looks like that faggot dad that you knew was a big fag even back when you were 5 years old.

Oh goodness. *Things that have literally never been said about someone who legitimately isn't a Typical Career Politician.

In his thirties, Erin became a leader in the business sector, honing his skills in advocacy and the law and engaging with leaders across industries. 

Erin’s time spent working in business revealed the critical roles of entrepreneurs and small business owners in creating jobs.

Rumour has it that Erin wore kneepads to work.

His Heart Has Always Been With Canadians
Family and service to others are the reasons Erin gets up every day. 

He’s volunteered with the Royal Canadian Legion and the Rotary Club. He’s helped in creating the Clarington Youth and Community Leadership Programme, and raised funds to build schools in Africa. 

He was also a founding member of the Board of Directors to a charity to support veterans, the True Patriot Love Foundation, which he has worked to raise millions of dollars for.

It's hilarious how much this reminds me of padding my resume when applying for minimum wage jobs back in my late teens early twenties. Let's see, utterly irrelevant volunteer work: CHECK! Vague Leadership Qualifications: CHECK! Then it differs as he brags about helping the poor negro chillin' in Africa, which is top tier required info in his line of work. Then there's the work experience part. I'm just a little surprised that he doesn't include a little something about "Erin is looking forward to a challenging new experience where he can learn useful skills and reach his full potential."

A Swift Rise Up The Ranks
Winning the by-election of Durham saw Erin enter Parliament in 2012. From there, he was appointed the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of International Trade and then became the Minister of Veterans Affairs in 2015. Erin applied his own military background to improve support and relations for Canada’s veterans.

Yeah it's a real mystery why this repulsive queer named Erin that nobody fucking likes had this meteoric rise through the Servative Party. Also weird how charismatic Maxime "Boomer Chad" Bernier, who everyone loved, mysteriously had this arduous rise through the same party before being kicked out. Also weird how <a href="../Articles/SERV_DerekSloanOut.html">I just finished writing an article</a> detailing the Cuckservative SqueezeOut of Derek Sloan. So if this little cuckold is trying to pretend that he isn't the beneficiary of vicious intra-party politics, then I just don't know what to say.

Erin’s Mission To Get The Economy Back On Track

Didn't he literally start with this platitude? Erin, sweetheart, you're a little early to be running out of material. Now this feels like an English essay that I really didn't want to write in high school where I had two real sentences worth of ideas, but I had to write a 6 paragraph essay.

Erin knows that working Canadians are at risk of being left behind by the current Liberal government and that the direction we choose to take in our economic recovery will be felt in the years to come.
‍
He knows a robust economic plan is the route to success, putting Canadian workers and job-creation at its centre.

Alrighty Erin. This is kind of just platitudes. I'm sure the next part is going to be more interesting.

Ready to Lead
Erin wasn’t raised to be a politician, but he’s always been a leader.  

Now, at a time when Canada needs a government that gets on with the job and leads from the front, Erin is ready to serve.

Finally goyim. Finally! Finally a man who wasn't raised to be a politician, but is a natural born leader is the one taking it to Justin Trudeau. After all, Joffrey Trudeau once dressed up as a brown guy 30 years ago. HE MUST BE PUNISHED!

Anyway, that's it for Erin O'Toole. He's pretty much everything you expected.
