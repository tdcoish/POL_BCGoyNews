Before I get into the article on BC Liberal Party Chair Nicole Paul, I saw her retweeting an article written by none other than Simrath Grewal. That name doesn't mean anything to me, but anything promoted by her is basically the thinking of the the BC Liberal Insiders. There are also some moderately interesting insights.

TDC_ARTICLE_START
What are BC Liberals? Are they liberals or conservatives? Looking back at British Columbia’s political history and their 16 years in government, one thing becomes clear: they’re neither.
TDC_ARTICLE_STOP
No their just straight up whores for the Donor Class.
TDC_ARTICLE_START
Instead of rebuilding the BC Liberals as Conservatives or Liberals, the focus must be listening to the issues of real people in all parts of the province and delivering on those needs according to bedrock values of fiscal responsibility and social progressiveness.
TDC_ARTICLE_STOP
Aaaaaaaaannndd there you have it. I skipped through the tedious and unimportant bits of the article, to once again drill into your head that these people are:
1) Do whatever Corporations want.
2) But also do everything that Perverts want.
So you get absolutely nothing here.

But if we yet again skip ahead, we get some interesting gaslighting.
TDC_ARTICLE_START
In 2020, the BC Liberals lost 5% of their vote share from 2017; the NDP gained 5% and the BC Conservatives gained 1.9%. These numbers demonstrate a simple truth – reducing the BC Conservative vote to zero will still not be enough to win the next election. Voters have bled to the NDP and Greens for the last two elections; until and unless they come back, there’s no winning path.

Curious that a brown guy is pushing the whole "we need to clone the anti-white NDP and Green Parties." In reality, the BC Conservatives are jokes. For those who don't know, I visited the BC Conservative Party Website at least once a week leading up to the election. Their website didn't change at all. If that's all you looked at, you wouldn't even know that there was an election going on. They only ran 19 candidates in the election, despite there being 87 seats. They didn't win a single seat. I think the most votes they got in any riding was something like 15%.

Despite this, they still got more votes than last time, because people are so fed up with the Liberal Party, and are willing to, gasp*, throw their votes away, in order to give a big Fuck You to the BC Liberals. Everybody hates these people, and a shift towards Pervertism is what already happened. Or in reality they became more honest.
TDC_ARTICLE_START
Some argue that absorbing the BC Conservative vote would close the gap. But this ignores the much larger problem of voters switching to the NDP and Greens, making ridings competitive that otherwise had no business being competitive. Tight races in these ridings make the BC Conservatives’ small margins more important than they ought to be.

For example, in 2013, BC Conservative leader John Cummins ran against Mary Polak in Langley and came a distant third.

51% BC Liberal (14,039)
27% BC NDP (7,403)
12% BC Conservative (3,242)
In 2020, the results were dramatically different:

45% BC NDP (6,460)
35% BC Liberal (5,040)
11% BC Conservative (1,583)
It’s clear the BC Liberal pool has shrunk because of voters not showing up, or switching to the NDP. In fact, the BC Conservatives won fewer votes in 2020 than they did in 2013. We can win the popular vote and beat the BC Conservatives by drawing regular voters back into the BC Liberal tent.

This is hilarious when you realize that there was an election in 2017. In that election, the BC Conservatives won less than 1% of the vote. They won more this time around. The reason that he doesn't bring up the 2017 election is because it showed that the BC Conservatives, a totally destroyed LOLcow of a party, grew in numbers because people just fucking hate the BC Liberals. At least enough to get behind certain candidates and lose seats for the BC Liberals.

The future of the BC Liberal Party rests not in ideological shifts but ideas and policies that speak to British Columbians who share fiscally responsible, and socially progressive values.
TDC_ARTICLE_STOP
This is basically just a meme at this point. Anyway, let's take a look at Simreth Grewal's bio.
TDC_ARTICLE_START
Simrath Grewal is a public affairs strategic advisor with experience in public policy, strategic communications, and politics. Simrath has served as a political aide to a number of elected officials, and held senior roles in the BC Liberal Party, starting out as president of the BC Young Liberals.

So there you have it. Yet again, they will push to be the party that does nothing for the peasants.
