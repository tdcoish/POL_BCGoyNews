The Conservative Party has a big problem when it comes to winning federal elections, and Erin O’Toole’s team knows it.

While the party reliably draws about a third of the popular vote every election, it has little hope of ever consistently winning majority governments without substantially raising its voter ceiling.

“Conservatives have essentially run the same campaign over and over again since 2006,” one O’Toole adviser said. “Strategically, the differences between the campaigns have been marginal…If we want to win, we have to do something different.”

So O’Toole is indeed trying something different, as has become strikingly apparent in his speeches and political ads since being elected leader in August. His goal is to expand the pool of people who vote Conservative, finding new voters among the working class and lower middle class who have drifted away from the left and become disengaged from electoral politics.

Oh god, I don't think I can take how fake and gay this is going to be. Before reading further I'm going to predict this will not be making appeals to White People, nor will this be going hard on the Child Tranny Issue, despite both being legitimately popular.

I'm just going to skip ahead to the part of this article where I'm proven correct.

Hence, the unconventional speech O’Toole gave to the Canadian Club of Toronto two weeks ago that raised eyebrows across the country.

“It may surprise you to hear a Conservative bemoan the decline of private sector union membership,” said O’Toole. “But this was an essential part of the balance between what was good for business and what was good for employees. Today, that balance is dangerously disappearing. Too much power is in the hands of corporate and financial elites who have been only too happy to outsource jobs abroad.”
TDC_ARTICLE_STOP
Nailed it.

The speech said Canadian workers used to be able to expect full-time employment, a steady salary and a pension, but that now feels like a “bygone era.”

“Do we really want a nation of Uber drivers?” O’Toole said. “Do we really want to abandon a generation of Canadians to some form of Darwinian struggle? A future without the possibility of home ownership? A sense of inevitability? While some benefit, millions are losing hope and resentment is growing.”

He questioned Canada’s trading relationship with China, and said his party will put more emphasis on the national interest. “Free markets alone won’t solve all our problems,” O’Toole said.

Oh dear god just make it stop. Maybe I shouldn't write articles past 10PM, but I just can't take it goyim, I really can't. So the shot here is to take peoples declining standard of life, at least economically, and to channel that into bullshit about "muh Chyyyna". What normal people want is quite simple:
1) Fuck Trannies/Perverts
2) Fuck Antifa/BLM
3) Fuck Billionaires
4) Fuck Foreigners
5) Give me more money
Anyone who can hit those notes will win elections. So the only reason he isn't getting up on stage and doing that bit, is because he has no interest in doing a single thing for you.

Afterward, a panelist on CBC said O’Toole sounded more like Bernie Sanders than a Conservative leader. But the strategy behind O’Toole’s comments is based in part on what’s already worked in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia, where right-wing parties have been picking up working class votes — and winning elections.

“Look, I think the writing has been on the wall for actually quite some time on this,” said Patrick Muttart, who was instrumental in shaping the campaign strategy for Harper’s Conservatives in their string of victories from 2006 to 2011. He spoke with the National Post from London, England, where he now works in the private sector.

So we can see now that the Donor-Right has moved from fake Populism on Social Issues, while being horrible on economic issues, to fake Populism on economics, while being horrible on Social Issues.

In 2005, Muttart started using intensive polling data to segment the Canadian population and pinpoint voters to target through tax breaks and tough-on-crime policies. But as he created an ideological map of Canadian voters, he found there was a “white space” made up of voters who are economically moderate or even left-leaning, but culturally conservative.

“They’re not socialist, but they may have left-of-centre instincts on certain things, and are driven more by economic performance rather than economic ideology,” Muttart said.

“But they do tend to be quite culturally conservative in that they believe in the idea of Canadian identity, they believe in the idea of strong, controlled borders, they certainly believe that the justice system needs to be tough but fair,” Muttart said. “And they also have a problem with pervasive political correctness, cancel culture, those sorts of things.”

Make it stop. This has been known forever. It's called Nationalists, who are also Socialists. Some people call them National Socialists. Average everyday people do not want Multinational Tech Conglomerates with trillion dollar evaluations censoring them off the internet that their taxes built in the first place. They also don't like Trannies. We can see with this faggots pivot here that he is still not offering this, since I have quoted him in previous articles being a "proud supporter of the LGBT" community.

For those wanting a quick analysis. The Donors can't have one party with all the popular issues. They need to split up the unpopular issues. That way they can pretend that Donor-Left party is really trying super hard for your economic wellbeing, but Donor-Right party causes them to have a 0% win rate. While Donor-Right party is really trying hard to not let trannies rape your kids, but Donor-Left party causes them to have a 0% win rate. 

So rest assured, National Populism is still NOT ON THE TABLE GOY.

At least one group of voters O’Toole is targeting are trades workers, such as people who belong to construction unions. As Conservatives sometimes point out, it’s unionized workers who build the pipelines and natural resource projects championed by their party. But the party’s stance against organized labour may be turning away people who would otherwise vote for them.
TDC_ARTICLE_STOP
No, really? You mean the Donor-Right official position of "LOL: Go fuck yourself, we support scab labour," is not popular with the actual men who's lives are diminished by this. I am fucking shocked, SHAWKED to hear that.

“One of the largest voter blocs in 2019, if you look across the parties, was non-voters,” said Sean Speer, a former Harper strategist who now writes frequently about Conservatives and the working class. “You have a third of eligible voters not voting. If you can get even a fraction of those, you can change the political dynamics.
Speer, a National Post columnist, said he believes many of these voters should naturally fall into the Conservative camp, but they’ve perceived the party as “concerned about elite issues” when it comes to economics. He describes them as “people who don’t like the left’s positioning on cultural issues, but have not been comfortable supporting Conservatives in the past because of their emphasis on markets and capitalism (as ends in themselves).”
“The left always goes on about income inequality, and they have a point,” the adviser said. “There is serious inequality in Canada that Conservatives have to wake up to, and that is the inequality that exists primarily between those who are well educated, who live in a city, who have a higher income, and those who don’t. The gap just keeps getting bigger and bigger. That’s the inequality that needs to be addressed and that Conservatives have to take seriously.”

All of this, while I must emphasize, IS NOT ACTUAL POLICY, is rhetoric that could be heard coming out of my mouth, or anyone in the National Justice Party. However...

But changing the Conservative Party’s message on economic issues — and especially saying nice things about organized labour — comes with significant risk as well. There has already been some pushback from caucus members, sources say, though overall most of the party’s MPs and senators understand the need to forge a new strategy.

“It’s a bit of a reorientation, and of course there’ll be resistance to that,” said one party source. “But if you want to keep doing it the same way, you can expect the same result.”

There’s also the issue of O’Toole’s own record. Unions abhorred two Conservative private members bills that were passed during the Harper majority years, bills C-377 (which forced more financial disclosure on federally-regulated unions) and C-525 (which mandated secret ballot certification votes and made it easier to decertify.) O’Toole voted in favour of both. When the Liberals won their majority in 2015, one of their first moves was repealing both bills.

O’Toole’s office did not answer directly when asked whether O’Toole regrets his votes on those bills or would vote differently today. “Mr. O’Toole is committed to unionized workers and is looking for new ways to support workers,” a spokesperson said. “We will have more to share in the coming weeks.”
TDC_ARTICLE_STOP
Yeah, this is empty rhetoric. 

Look, Donors understand how this works. The Donor-Left will become so horrifically awful that they feel the Donor-Right can give empty platitudes on economic issues and that should be it. Actual Union Leaders don't buy this for a second.

Jerry Dias, who as Unifor national president leads the largest private sector union in the country, isn’t about to let O’Toole forget about those votes — or the work O’Toole did on free trade agreements from 2013 to 2015, when he was parliamentary secretary to the minister of international trade.

“He’s really working on the premise that people have short memories,” Dias told the Post. “He says all of the right things, but the problem is his history is the opposite. That’s going to be his biggest hurdle, to convince people: ‘Everything that I have stood for was all bullshit. I’m a new man today.'”

O’Toole’s strategy is aimed at workers, not union leadership. But he’s also done himself no favours in this regard. “I will be Jerry Dias’ worst nightmare,” O’Toole told a crowd last January when he was launching his leadership campaign, describing Dias as one of the “fat cat union leaders.” O’Toole’s campaign later gleefully boasted about how Dias was running attack ads against him.

Dias said O’Toole is now trying to take the same path as Donald Trump in the U.S., and he thinks Canadians will see through the sudden shift to union-friendly messaging.

“I just don’t see it as genuine,” Dias said. “Am I pleased that he’s saying it? Yes. Do I believe he means it? No.”

That brings up the biggest question of all: what does all this mean for a campaign platform? Is O’Toole’s new approach largely just a communications strategy, or will it result in concrete promises that substantially differ from what voters have seen before?

O’Toole’s team, for obvious reasons, is not giving away their platform — above all because it’s still being developed. Expect it to be tough on China, tough on crime, and heavy with emphasis on building strong communities. What that actually means is yet to be seen.

Yeah this exists so that they don't have to talk about immigration, and because they've become so discredited on social issues. Personally, I just don't see it working, but this isn't some political brilliance on the part of Erin O'Toole, if the Cuckservative Party wants to win elections at all, this was their only hope.

So no, you're still getting fucked here.
