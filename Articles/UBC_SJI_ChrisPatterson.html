Christopher B. Patterson is an Assistant Professor in the Social Justice Institute at the University of British Columbia. His research focuses on transpacific discourses of literature, games, and films through the lens of empire studies, queer theory and creative writing. His first academic book, Transitive Cultures: Anglophone Literature of the Transpacific (Rutgers University Press, 2018), examines Southeast Asian diasporic novels focusing on queer migrants, those who resist ethnic stereotypes, and those who feel few ties to their ostensible homelands. His second academic book, Open World Empire: Race, Erotics, and the Global Rise of Video Games (New York University Press, 2020), sees video games as an artistic expression of global empire by playing them erotically and as Asiatic commodities. His articles have appeared in venues such as Cultural Studies, American Quarterly, and many others.

I'm almost too stunned for commentary. "He sees video games as an artistic expression of global empire by playing them erotically and as Asiatic commodities." One sentence that could spawn an entire 10,000 word essay. How fucking cartoonishly useless do you need to be to have to write such a sentence, LET ALONE WRITE A FUCKING BOOK ABOUT IT? That's a rhetorical question, the answer is completely and utterly useless. 

It's a sentence so fucking stupid that it almost made me forget about his other book, which looks reasonable by comparison. Yes, the book about "Southeast Asian Diasporic novels focusing on queer migrants." Actually re-reading it now I can see that this guy is writing non-fiction here about those novels. Like he's doing a metastudy or something about all the novels that have been written about Asian Perverts Who Are Well Assimilated Into Globo Homo And Don't Care About China Anymore. That is such a weirdly specific category of novels. How many fucking novels have been written about that?

NOTE: As always, I love being the Grammar Nazi, and while this little faggot writes fairly well, he did in fact make a fairly rudimentary mistake. "Asiatic commodities," needs to have commodities capitalized. The cocksucker needs to write it as Asiatic Commodities, if he wants to look as smart as he feels when writing it. I know this might be small, but it's literally his biography.

The next paragraph is just boring resume stuff, not particularly funny either, but hold on to your humpernickels goyim, because the part after is a blast.

Chris writes fiction under his pseudonym Kawika Guillermo, and is the author of Stamped: an anti-travel novel (Westphalia Press, 2018), and the queer speculative novel All Flowers Bloom (Westphalia Press, 2020). He serves as the current editor-in-chief of decomp journal.

TL:DR:
1) Writes fiction under the pen name of Kawika Guillermo
2) Also, admits to writing under a pen name, sort of defeating the entire purpose.
3) Has written an "anti-travel novel." Again, baffled that's a thing.
4) Has written a "queer speculative novel." Again, not sure that isn't just a random assortment of words.
5) "He sees video games as an artistic expression of global empire by playing them erotically and as Asiatic commodities."
6) Did a meta study of "Southeast Asian Diasporic novels focusing on queer migrants."
7) Editor in chief of "decomp journal," whatever that is.

I hope I didn't miss anything.
