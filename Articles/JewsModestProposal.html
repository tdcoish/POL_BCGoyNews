So (((Scott Alexander))), one of the weirdest astroturfed political commentators around, recently wrote up a little piece of advice for the Finkle-Right Party, in America they're called the Republicans, goy. For those who don't know, Scott Alexander is some jew Psychiatrist, who is a self-admitted "Left-Libertarian," who at one point was bragging about being in a relationship with a tranny who went by the name of "Ozymandias." I know because, believe it or not, I was once a commenter on his old blog, SlateStarCodex. I got banned for being a big meanie to this tranny. 

Long story short, dudes got problems, but he was at least deemed enough of a, however contrived, threat to the privileged, that the New York Times doxxed him, giving everyone his real name, and published a hit piece explaining is psuedo-ideology. I have compassion for anonymity on the internet, so I won't print his name, but his ideology is that typical jew neo-Reactionary "we should just be honest and not let the goyim decide. Even puppet show 'democracy' is too much." In fairness, he combines this with occassionally not terrible autistic critiques of things he's an expert in, such as the pharmaceutical industry.

A Modest Proposal For Republicans: Use The Word "Class"

I hear you're having a post-Trump identity crisis.
TDC_ARTICLE_STOP
Stop. This is already fake and gay. The Finkle-Right is not suffering from an "identity crisis," post Trump. They are suffering from a Credibility Crisis. Don the con, for all his faults, at least showed that their old plan was totally fake and gay, utterly astroturfed. They realize that they can't just go back to that, so they need a new fake thing to pivot to. This is where Scott comes in to help them.
TDC_ARTICLE_START
So here's my recommendation: use the word "class". Pivot from mindless populist rage to a thoughtful campaign to fight classism.

Yeah, yeah, "class" sounds Marxist, class warfare and all that, you're supposed to be against that kind of thing, right? Wrong. Economic class warfare is Marxist, but here in the US class isn't a purely economic concept. Class is also about culture. You're already doing class warfare, you're just doing it blindly and confusedly. Instead, do it openly, while using the words "class" and “classism”.

I'm trying to recapture my spirit the first time I read this. I thought there might be something to this. Spoiler: there isn't.
TDC_ARTICLE_START
Trump didn't win on a platform of capitalism and liberty and whatever. He won on a platform of being anti-establishment. But which establishment? Not rich people. Trump is rich, lots of his Cabinet picks were rich, practically the first thing he did was cut taxes on the rich. Some people thought that contradicted his anti-establishment message, but those people were wrong. Powerful people? Getting warmer, but Mike Pence is a powerful person and Trump wasn't against Mike Pence. Smart people? Now you're burning hot.

Lol wut? This jew keeps trying to memory hole that Trump in 2016 most importantly ran on "I'm going to kick all these fucking Mexicans out of our country." Also, "I'm going to not allow Muslims in." He didn't get elected because of his fucking cabinet picks, and if people had known who he would have picked for his (((cabinet))), there would have been a whole lot less excitement about him.
Keep that narrative in mind, because this jew keeps trying to pretend that Trump 2016 didn't run on anything tangible. He literally ran on building a wall as his committment to kicking foreigners out. There was other stuff about "draining the swamp," that was made believable only because the guy ran on actual tangible populist policies.
TDC_ARTICLE_START
Trump stood against the upper class. He might define them as: people who live in nice apartments in Manhattan or SF or DC and laugh under their breath if anybody comes from Akron or Tampa. Who eat Thai food and Ethiopian food and anything fusion, think they would gain 200 lbs if they ever stepped in a McDonalds, and won't even speak the name Chick-Fil-A. Who usually go to Ivy League colleges, though Amherst or Berkeley is acceptable if absolutely necessary. Who conspicuously love Broadway (especially Hamilton), LGBT, education, "expertise", mass transit, and foreign anything. They conspicuously hate NASCAR, wrestling, football, "fast food", SUVs, FOX, guns, the South, evangelicals, and reality TV. Who would never get married before age 25 and have cutesy pins about how cats are better than children. Who get jobs in journalism, academia, government, consulting, or anything else with no time-card where you never have to use your hands. Who all have exactly the same political and aesthetic opinions on everything, and think the noblest and most important task imaginable is to gatekeep information in ways that force everyone else to share those opinions too.

Almost true. Trump ran on an incoherent fascist policy of "you the normal people are being oppressed by vague swamp creatures," once again I might add, in addition to his very tangible, very detailed anti-foreigner plan. It's worth mentioning, Trump never said "I don't like people who eat Thai Foot and fusions," or whatever bullshit this jew is trying to pretend was going on. His biggest supporters were goyim who were sick of being oppressed by jews, yet another thing that this jew is trying to memory hole.

And I frankly find it insulting the characterization he has of us 2016 Trump supporters. I think WWE is fucking retarded. NASCAR is boring and stupid. Football is a waste of time. Fast Food is unhealthy. SUV's, well, I wish I could afford one, so no comment. FOX is unwatcheable Finkle-Right propaganda. Evangelicals are annoying, but I'm fine with working something out with them politically. 

On top of that, he really, I mean really plays up the whole "Trump ran against people who are intelligent and high-class." Like, that's just flat out not what was going on. Trump ran against Schlomo and his minions, and while it was totally fake, that's what was going on. Not "muh WWF".

Aren't I just describing well-off people? No. Teachers, social workers, grad students, and starving artists may be poor, but can still be upper-class. Pilots, plumbers, and lumber barons are well-off, but not upper-class. Donald Trump is a billionaire, but still recognizably not upper class. The upper class is a cultural phenomenon.
TDC_ARTICLE_STOP
<img src="../Images/memeFactCheckMostlyFalse.png">
Teachers, social workers, grad students, and starving artists are by definition not "upper class." What they can be, and many times are, is obedient Non-Player-Characters. Or if you would like "System Enforcers." Maybe even "Grown Up Tattle Tales". There is nothing more "leftist," than Antifa, and there is nothing more "Antifa," than tattle-taling to $200 billion dollar Mark Zuckerberg "oh my god mr moneybags, this peasant disagrees with the politics of a corporate human resources department." The reason normal people want "leftists," to be killed is because they, however incoherently, understand them to be the middle managers of their oppression.
TDC_ARTICLE_START
Instead, just use the words "class" and “classism”. Say "Hey, we Republicans want to be the party of the working class. We are concerned about the rising power of the upper class, and we are dedicated to stamping out classism."

Maybe I shouldn't roll my eyes at that, because it somehow manages to be an improvement over the Finkle-Right "muh capitalism, muh israel," rhetoric. However, it's still so bad it's funny. It's also nothing new. I'd like to <a href="../Articles/ErinOTooleFakePopulism.html">point to my article</a> I wrote back in November 2020 where I showed that the Finkle-Right have been trying this pivot to "Multi-Racial Working Class," empty rhetoric for a long time now.

And that's all it is, empty rhetoric. The Finkle-Right absolutely does not want to advocate for White People, so they won't advocate for White People, even in the era of ((("try to be less White"))), training. However, they've had a 0% winrate on Social Issues for so long that they've become discredited there as well. As a result they need to pivot to something, and they view this as their new meal ticket. For the record, I think that Finkle-Rightism is just flat out done, which makes for interesting times, my friend. 
TDC_ARTICLE_START
It's the 21st century; having principles is out of style. Politics is motivated by tribal hatred. You tell your people that the other side hates them and wants to kill them; they need to fight back. The Democrats are great at this - cis white men hate you, they deny your right to exist, the cruelty is the point, resist or be destroyed. You Republicans have been caught flat-footed. You can’t openly defend cis white men; that would be transphobic racist sexist. And you can’t openly attack trans black women - that would be super transphobic racist sexist. Plus it wouldn’t work; there aren’t that many of them, and they’re not powerful enough to be scary.

It's at this point that his little screed goes off the rails. This is so amazingly wrong that it's chuckle-worthy. 
"You can't advocate for White People, because then the utterly hated and discredited media is going to attack you." 
Okay so... tell the (((Weapons of Mass Destruction Liars))) to go fuck themselves? Everybody hates the media, it's not a tribal thing, unless you mean jew versus goy, it's a universally shared thing. These people are nothing more than the mouthpieces for the privileged and powerful, so the idea that you can't advocate against Racial Discrimination Against White People is so far beyond ridiculous that it's actually funny that this little jew would even try this. And on top of that, LOL, just LOL at "omfg I might be called transphobic." Like, what? 

BTW, in California of all places, the least White, and supposedly most Finkle-Left state in the union, it was put up to vote whether or not it should be legal to Racially Discriminate against White People in November, 2020. It got voted down, 56% to 44%. Anti-Whitism isn't popular. Defending White People is popular. The cult of imaginary jew victimhood on the other hand...

Trump outmanuevered the Republican establishment by finding a front where he could go on the offensive. He de-emphasized the unfavorable terrain of race/sex/etc, and focused on class. He didn't use the word "class". But he captured the idea. He implicitly understood that there was some kind of difference between the average working-class voter and the sorts of people who set trends in the media, academia, government, et cetera. Whenever an upper-class institution tried to make him admit that they were the experts and he should bow to them, he spat in their faces instead. This was terrible; he spat in the faces of epidemiologists trying to tell him about an epidemic! But it sent his message loud and clear - just as South African populist Thabo Mbeki denied HIV/AIDS partly as a way of spitting in the face of the rich white countries who wanted him not to.
TDC_ARTICLE_STOP
<img src="../Images/memeConfused.jpg">
Lol wut? Trump "de-emphasized" race? Trump literally ran against BLM in 2016. Trump ran on kicking members of a foreign race out of our country. You can say that "well, White People read too much into his rhetoric," and I think this is true, but 99% of people thought he was running on a pro-White platform. Then in 2020 Trump ran on "500 billion for blax," and lost the White vote, and the election. 
Also, LOL at Republicans "emphasizing sex/race/etc." They literally do the opposite all the time. The above paragraph is the opposite of the truth.
TDC_ARTICLE_START
It could appeal to the white working class. Everyone agreed these people were Trump's base, but the media insisted on emphasizing the "white", as in “WHITE!!! working class”. Your job is to get people thinking “white WORKING CLASS!!!” instead. You cannot ethically or pragmatically flatter these people's identity as whites, but you can very easily flatter their identity as the working class.

<img src="../Images/pepeConfused.png">
Aca-Scuse-Me? "You can't ethically flatter [White People's] identity?" Please explain mr. jew, I think we would all really love to hear this one.
TDC_ARTICLE_START
It could appeal to Republicans who are in it for the capitalism (including the rich donors). You would argue that capitalism is the system that lets people succeed regardless of class; even the most uncouth and uneducated person can strike it rich if they work hard and make good deals. The Democrats hate this; they prefer a system where powerful insiders get to play favorites, where success depends on who you know and not what you know, and where good jobs are locked behind gates of correct credentials from the right colleges.

<img src="../Images/memeTiresome2.jpg">
This is literally Finkle-Right propaganda for the past 50 years. This is nothing new. They have always tried to make the argument of "well, muh capitalism is secretly good for working class people... somehow." One of the biggest problems that they have right now is that it has been shown, not just in secret polling, but by the election of Don the Con himself, that this is NOT FUCKING POPULAR. Appeals to "muh Capitalism," have been show to be negatively popular, in that politicians who are accused of being "Socialists," actually get a bump in the polls after such accusations. Any bitch who trots out the "muh billionaires," bullshit in the year 2021 is unelectable, unless its opponent is virulently anti-White or pro-pervert.
TDC_ARTICLE_START
It could appeal to small-government libertarians. Argue that the Democrats and the government are a jobs program for the upper class. All those Institutes For X and Public Service Campaigns For Y, all those regulations that require two hundred lawyers just to move a potted plant, all those laws that mean every company needs fifty compliance offers working full time just in order to not get sued, they're all a giant jobs program for college-educated people who refuse to work with their hands.
TDC_ARTICLE_STOP
<img src="../Images/memeTiresome1.jpg">
It's almost more frustrating to see a policy that I half want, as opposed to something I can outright fight against. Small government lolbertarians are complete faggots, who need to get utterly crushed politically. "Muh regulations," needs to get chuckled at. Much better rhetoric: "These Universities, staffed by the privileged, need to be destroyed. The faculty needs to be made into janitors, or publicly humiliated. And oh, BTW, we're going to be making it illegal to discriminate against holding a university degree or not. However, we are going to build real institutions of higher education, that serve you, the people."
TDC_ARTICLE_START
It could appeal to Asians, another up-for-grab minority demographic. Asians know they've done the hard work and gotten the test scores that ought to make them successful, but somehow success isn't coming. We all know why this is - they're being excluded by an academic establishment that believes "meritocracy" is a dirty word. Your job is to make the obvious point that Democrats have transformed college admissions from a search for talented students, into a scheme to perpetuate class advantage.
TDC_ARTICLE_STOP
<img src="../Images/memeUnimpressedSquirrel2.jpg">
So this jew is in favour of explicit racial appeals to Asians, but not White People. So this is anti-White propaganda. I can't stress enough how weird some Republican going out there and saying "muh Asians are discriminated against," when everyone knows that White People are the ones being mostly discriminated against. So this is incredibly weird, disengenous, and anti-White. Thanks, jew.
TDC_ARTICLE_START
It could appeal to intellectuals. Right now you're doing so badly among this demographic that you're going to have trouble staffing the next generation of think tanks. That's because you have a lot of anger but no theory. Intellectuals love theories. Your theory will be something something classism, details to be filled in later. Intellectuals love filling in details, especially details about -isms, and you can assure them that they'll be very busy.

Wow, useless eaters. Yes, this is definitely a demographic that deserves being catered to. Going to a bunch of truckers and saying "hey, do you think it would be funny/good if we killed 10-20% of academics." This is not going to resonate with "muh Multi Racial Working Class." Instead, going to said truckers and saying "the proletariate are being class oppressed by the upper class." Yes, this will definitely resonate with the "lower classes." 

For the record goy, I used to be a trucker going from British Columbia to California all the time. I met a lot of people. When I would try to talk to them about politics, you know what they would say? "The violence that is done to Black Trans bodies of colour needs to stop."

As it currently exists, college is a scheme for laundering and perpetuating class advantage. You need to make the case that bogus degree requirements (eg someone without a college degree can't be a sales manager at X big company, but somebody with any degree, even Art History or Literature, can) are blatantly classist.
TDC_ARTICLE_STOP
People who were propagandized their entire lives into going to university, and getting some utterly worthless "Art History" Degree, are victims. I don't care about this fucking kikes fake "muh class oppression" narrative. Those people are victims. If those people espouse what this kike would call "woke" politics, ie. anti-Whitism and pervertism, they can be dealt with on an individual basis. Otherwise, fuck this fucking kike. This fucking kike. Fuck you.

Argue that you love and support legitimate experts, but that the Democrats have invented and propped up a fake concept of expertise as a way of making sure upper-class people who can game admissions to top colleges control the discourse. Your solution will be prediction markets. Yes, really. Repeal all bans on prediction markets and give tax breaks for participating in them, until they have the same kind of liquidity as the S&P500. You'll get a decentralized, populist, credentialism-free, market-based alternative to expertise. When the prediction markets outperform 75% of experts, fire them and say this proves you were right all along that government-sponsored expertise was just a jobs program for the upper-class. The remaining 25% of experts are cool and you will definitely listen to them very closely about whatever they have to say.

<img src="../Images/laughingSupermodels.jpg">
This is where his piece goes completely off the rails. Prediction market eh? Funny. We just saw with WallStreetBets how utterly manipulated real FUTURES MARKETS are by multi-billion dollar hedge fund managers are. You know, the people who give politicians billions of dollars? So I'm supposed to believe, based on nothing, that the people should give up something like Direct Democracy, in order to be ruled over by (((experts))). And in order for this to even arguable as a benefit we need we need to have both:
1) A genuine system will be set up that allows fair competition from anyone in this predictions market.
2) A guarantee that whatever predictions made won't be at all manipulated by the privileged and powerful for their benefits.
Like, there is absolutely no reason for anyone with a brain to just assume, based on nothing I might add, that this scenario will occur. This is so fucking stupid, that it borders on satire. The only possible response is just to point and laugh.

War On The Upper-Class Media: This is your new term for "mainstream media". Being against the "mainstream media" sounds kind of conspiratorial. Instead, you’re against the upper-class media, which gains its status by systematically excluding lower-class voices, and which exists mostly as a tool of the upper classes to mock and humiliate the lower class. You are not against journalism, you're not against being well-informed, you're against a system that exists to marginalize people like you. Tell the upper-class media that if they want your respect, they need to stop class discrimination.

There's so much wrong with this. He goes on to point out how NYT editors are less likely to watch the superbowl than normal people. Also, "96% of political donations from journalists go to Democrats." The only arguable good thing he goes on about is to argue that Finkle-Rightists should therefore take a page out of the psuedo-Marxists critique and call the "mainstream media" "classists," and then ignore them. Ignoring them is fine, but that's such a hilariously fake and gay reason for ignoring them. Consider the difference between:
"Look everybody, these classist New York Times journalists are attacking me as being 'racist'".
"Look goyim, the propagandists who lied us into Iraq and Afghanistan are attacking me racially as a White Man, because I am your advocate."
Do you see how much more powerful and moving the latter is? Now understand that the Schlomo writing this piece is trying to get you into booth 1, versus booth 2.

4. War On Wokeness. But now it's because wokeness is a made-up mystery religion that college-educated people invented so they could feel superior to you. Why are they so sure that "some of my best friends are black" doesn't make you any less racist? Because the whole point is that the only way not to be racist is to master an inscrutable and constantly-changing collection of fashionable shibboleths and opinions which are secretly class norms.

<img src="../Images/memeTiresome3.png">
Jesus Fucking Christ. I don't think I need to print anymore, you get the idea. It's literally anything, anything at all to prevent you from blaming Schlomo, no matter how guilty Schlomo is.

Anyway, that's the whole article. I skimmed it a bit, but nothing of value was lost. The TL:DR on the whole thing is:

1) Please dear god please Whitey do not defend Whites as White People.
2) The reason you can't do that is because the Weapons of Mass Destruction Liars might attack you.
3) Also, you should be attacking the "mainstream media," but only with some race-blind psuedo-marxist "class critique".
4) Forget that Donald Trump was elected on an explicit anti-Forgeigner Campaign, with real policies.
5) Make utterly fake rhetorical arguments towards "muh Multi Racial Working Class".
6) Did I mention to please not advocate for White people?
7) Make sure to refer to your enemies as "Upper Class," instead of jews please.
8) Definitely don't point out that literally 100% of the things the filthy goyim, I mean Republican Voters, hate is because of jews.
9) Talk in vague platitudes a lot. This is good for your electoral chances.
10) Something something appeal to the very psuedo-intellectuals that everybody hates. This is very important.
11) Also Democracy is gay, put all power in "prediction markets." (This one was so fucking stupid that I almost forgot)

I mean the list goes on, but it's such obviously Finklethink. It's just so fake and gay that it's kind of annoying. Something you should look at for a second, then move on.
