'We are already at a disadvantage': Indigenous college students concerned about online learning
TDC_ARTICLE_STOP 
In case you are wondering, this article is written by, uh, "Ka'nhehsi:io Deer," real name "Jessica Deer," the really mentally fucked up propagandist I wrote about in my article <a href="../Articles/WhiteLadyCaughtLARPingAsAbo.html">White Lady Caught LARPing as Abo</a>, wherein a White Woman who was a celebrated Abo filmmaker was caught as a White Woman, then had her story printed up by Jessica Deer, who is also a White Woman LARPing as an Abo. Jessica hasn't been officially caught yet, which is the difference. She is also blonde.

Anyway, if you don't feel like reading this entire story, the TL:DR is that Abos are whining about nothing again. I swear to god, these people whine about nothing more than Schlomo, they just aren't nearly as successful at getting concessions.

Kyla Morris, a psychology student from Kahnawake, Que., is nervous about the fall semester being primarily online due to the coronavirus pandemic.

"For someone who needs extra help, I go see a tutor. It will be a bit harder for me to get what I need," she said.

This is definitely not a problem that White Students have, and is something that Abos uniquely have to deal with. After all, tutor isn't really a French word, it's Iraquois for "dumb kid needs help".

Morris, who attends Dawson College in Montreal, started classes this week. The majority of her classes are being held online but she said she is happy at least one class will require her to go on campus.

"I really do like going to school. I think it will be helpful," said Morris.

She's among a group of Indigenous post-secondary students in and around Montreal who issued a statement to their respective colleges about education during the pandemic calling for "creative and flexible" solutions that meet the needs of Indigenous students and their unique experiences.

I read their whinefest and decided to not create an article on it. It's basic bitch "how can we parlay being brown into getting higher grades without doing work," garbage, so transparent in its desire that it's almost endearing. Well, if it weren't implicitly Anti-White that is. 

As far as Kyla herself goes, while this is Anti-White propaganda, it does touch on how much of our society has been exposed as a complete and utter joke by CoronaChan. Universities are charging students full price despite them not even physically showing up, making the argument that 100% of the value of a University can be obtained at home. It's just so absurd.

The letter came on the heels of many bad experiences Indigenous post-secondary students had during the spring when classes were moved online abruptly as a result of the pandemic. The letter stated that many students felt the workload got heavier with online lectures, essays and individual learning, and that they struggled with the lack of community support from other Indigenous students and staff.

It's why Morris made a group chat in the spring for Indigenous students who frequent Dawson's First Peoples' Centre for resource help and socializing.

"It's important that every student connects with another student to not feel lonely and know that they're not in this alone. We're in this all together," she said.

Meanwhile, I just <a href="../Articles/SWC_McGill.html">yesterday wrote an article</a> on Students for Western Civilization not being allowed on McGill University. Yet apparently I'm supposed to feel sadness for muh Abos who are temporarily without face to face communication. Yes, I truly am saddened by this.

Sometimes I'm too baffled to do analysis.
