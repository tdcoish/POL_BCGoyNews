I wrote up the story of Jessica "Wax my Female Balls, BIGOT!" Yaniv calling the Langley Fire Department 30+ times before they finally threatened legal action. However, he did something else really fucked up recently. To be precise, he showed off his vagina.
His.
His Vagina.

I was looking for pictures of this. Purely for content reasons, don't impune my honour. Although I have to admit, I kind of had a morbid fascination. What does a fake tranny vagine really look like? More importantly, he was tweeting about how he had a new weird slit growing inside of his fancy new vagina, and it was discharging fluid. 
I needed to see this.

JESUS FUCKING CHRIST WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU OMFG!

*Takes a 5 minute break.

Well anyway, the best article that I read on this happened to be my first, from MeowMix.

No Jon. It isn’t. It’s a post-op nightmare that will require extensive treatment and never look right. It’s a dehisced, hyper-granulated wound full of non-viable yellow tissue that will never heal right. It will probably require chemical or surgical debridement.

You were aiming for a coin slot pussy and didn’t even manage to get an axe wound. You went straight to sewage trench. In fact, some on Twitter are wondering if some of the skin discolouration in the picture is yellow bruising or brown….

My kinda goy. I took a casual perusal of other stuff on this goys website. I have to say, I love what I see. I'd suggest that you goys perhaps go and give him a looksie, because making fun of mentally ill trannies committing bodily harm is exactly the kind of light, fun content we need in these dark times.
