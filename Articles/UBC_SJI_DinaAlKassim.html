Dr. Dina Al-Kassim is a critical theorist, who works on political subjectivation, sexuality and aesthetics in transnational modernist and contemporary postcolonial cultures, including the Middle East, Africa, Europe and the United States.

JFC Dina, give me a break here. There is no tax on periods. Use them. 
TDC_ARTICLE_START
She is the author of On Pain of Speech: Fantasies of the First Order and the Literary Rant (University of California Press, 2010), which examines parrhesia and the politics of address in the practice of literary ranting.

"Politics of address in the practice of literary ranting." Like Dina I just have no idea WTF I'm reading here.
TDC_ARTICLE_START
Al-Kassim’s publications have appeared in Grey Room, International Journal of Middle East Women’s Studies, Public Culture, Cultural Dynamics, and the volume Islamicate Sexualities.
TDC_ARTICLE_STOP
"Islamicate Sexualities." Any other group of people writing that and I'd just assume it's some jargon I'm not privvy to. These useless eaters writing this shit and I'm pretty sure that Dina came up with that on the spot to make herself feel smart.
TDC_ARTICLE_START
Her current project, entitled Exposures: Biopolitics and New Precarity under Globalization asks why and how exposure has come to be a condition of contemporary truth through selective soundings in literature, arts practice, protest and politics from Lebanon, South Africa, and the United States.

Dina does a whole lot better than that Becki Bitch, who I wrote about first, on the punctuation front. Becki just went full "Grammar is Cisheteronormative Straight White Male Patriarchy, NO FUCKING PARAGRAPH BREAKS BITCHES!" A decision that I can almost respect for the sheer lunacy.
Dina on the other hand comes across as just extremely poor at writing. A missing comma after "Precarity under Globalization," ruins the flow of the sentence. Goys, I know I'm being picky but this is literally her professional biography and it's only two fucking paragraphs.
TDC_ARTICLE_START
Other projects include discrepant histories of colonial psychoanalysis and theories of anti-colonial solidarity.

Formerly a professor of Comparative Literature and Critical Theory at UC Irvine, Al-Kassim now teaches in the Department of English and The Social Justice Institute at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, where she is also an Associate at the Peter Wall Institute for Advanced Studies.  Al-Kassim has been a Mellon Postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University, a Senior Seminar Fellow at Harvard University’s Radcliffe Institute, and a Sawyer Seminar, Residency Fellow at the UCHRI. A much invited speaker here and abroad, Al-Kassim now divides her time between Vancouver and Los Angeles.

TL:DR:
1) "critical theorist"
2) "works on political subjectivation"
3) "sexuality and aesthetics in transnational modernist and contemporary postcolonial cultures"
4) "examines parrhesia and the politics of address in the practice of literary ranting."
5) "Islamicate Sexualities."

I'm just keeping a list. I skipped through the order to Becki, but Dina was first. I was thinking I might not actually write them all up, but I'm enjoying it. At the end I'm going to collect them all into one big list with all the most ridiculous quotes in there.
