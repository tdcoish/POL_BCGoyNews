Vincent Laanstra pushed open a bar door in Calgary as wind and snow beat down on the windows outside. Driving his parents’ car, he came from work at a major airline, where he claims to have helped conduct anti-discrimination classes before being laid off during the pandemic. A long time far-right activist, a few months later the son of Dutch immigrants would find himself the heir apparent to the leadership of ID Canada -- an anti-immigrant, antisemitic, anti-LGBTQ2S+ organization dedicated to preserving the country for who they view as its true founders, white Europeans.

Yeah I'm just as confused as you are trying to figure out where this guy is going with this. First, it starts off like he's writing some Science Fiction. "Hulk Skynor stepped out of the pontoon, a biting cold wind sweeping through his jacket, as the mining ships ready to haul off 100 megatons of unobtanium powered up their plasma cores."
Then it changes tune, and he, I guess, is trying to make fun of poor Vincent Laanstra because he has to drive his parents car. I think I speak for everyone who isn't a piece of shit when I say, that does not make me dislike someone, just the opposite.
Then, in the same sentence, he points out that Vincent Laanstra conducted "anti-discrimination classes," before being laid off. That... seems sort of like something that demands a followup. What kind of anti-discrimination classes were taught by Laanstra, and did that have anything to do with him leading this Pro-White Organization?
Now I know that this is a propaganda piece designed to slander a bunch of goyim, but why include such a thread if you're not going to follow up on it? It's just plain weird.
And finally, White People are the true founders of Canada. This isn't even controversial. It's just flat out what happened.

Once one of the largest white nationalist/alt-right organizations in Canada, I watched bickering and paranoia dwindle their numbers across the country into a handful of poorly motivated hangers on. Now paralyzed by the pandemic, the group is desperately trying to recover after its former leader isolated and cast out numerous members as suspected CSIS agents and repeatedly failed to spark renewed recruitment.

I looked up the author of this piece. Apparently he links his twitter at the bottom of the page, and his twitter handle is "MisterEPete". Honestly, I didn't bother figuring out any more about this guy, because I just wanted the picture of the pure soy behind this propaganda. The above is what I found. Some brief snooping found him to be that sort of intolerable faggot who posts a whole bunch of celebrity reacts gifs in response to whatever the conversation is. Here's a good example.
<img src="../Images/peteSmithCelebrityReacts.PNG"><figcaption>Also, LOL at this being genuine. Antifa exploits capital relations to get White Workers Fired.</figcaption>
So this is basically what we're dealing with. A guy who goes by the handle MisterEPete, who posts random celebrities (for the record, I have no idea what this one is from, but I assume some shit-tier netflix show), on twitter threads that get zero likes despite being half a month old.

Attempting to gain entry into the group is markedly simple, but monetized at almost every level -- at least in Ontario. Their website includes a brief questionnaire that screens for ideology; social media accounts (a fake account was submitted); and a small amount of personal information, including views on immigration. Journalists are asked to self identify -- I did not -- and a secure payment of $15 is required for membership.

I'm sorry, I still can't get over how much of a faggot this guy is that his twitter handle is MisterEPete. Then combine that with the above paragraph, where he acts like he's doing this Hunter S. Thompson gonzo journalism, despite working for an NGO. Like holy shit, this radical was asked to self-identify as a propagandist, and HE CHOSE NOT TO FUCKING WILD! 
I do like that these guys got him to pay them $15.00 for the privilege of talking to them.

The tests do not end at the in-person meeting. Initiates are continually screened to check for police affiliation, “antifa,” or general “degeneracy.” The initial vetting had gone well, but my first chapter meeting involved quizzes about my beliefs -- “how much Jewish ancestry before someone stops being European?” -- and on my background, part of which included being a former military member. 

After an error in a piece of Navy trivia, access to the chat was severed without warning.

“You’re a cop,” McCormack wrote under the screen name Woad when contacted. After providing more background information, including an old service number (I was, in fact, in the Navy), access was granted again.

In the Navy? Homosexual confirmed. And to think I ever wondered. 
More seriously, Wannabe Hunter S. Thompson But With AIDS brings up something interesting. Canada ID had a fairly good screening process, that I think is a very good idea for any pro-Goyim organization. That might sound like a weird thing to say when some hitpiece is being written by an infiltrating propagandist, but you also can't expect something to work 100% of the time, that's just silly. Having said that, the best, most functional part of the screening process is forcing recruits to pay $15.00 up front, far more than the questions.

Also in Red Deer, posters placed by an account linked to Baker about the “great replacement” were found littering the outside of a refugee centre. 

“I went to put up more but then homeless people started yelling things at me so I left,” she wrote under the screen name Juturna, after posting the photo.

“Exemplary work as always,” Laanstra wrote, “everyone can learn from your effort.”

Yeah, I'm skipping over most of the propaganda, but this part is hilarious. Everyone who has ever put up stickers has had experiences of weird shit like this, that only seem to happen when you're putting up stickers. I once went to UBC to scout out places to put up paraphanelia, and I swear to god it's like every possible event that could be happening was happening, and every single person was giving me these "do we know this guy?" type vibes as I casually sauntered through a graduation party for the UBC Biology majors, or what have you. 

It was kind of funny.

After a stop in Toronto in December 2019, Laanstra travelled to Europe, where he appeared in a picture with Italy’s Matteo Salvini, and claimed to have met Belgium’s Tom Van Grieken, both prominent far-right, anti-immigration politicians. Boasting in the chat about a rendezvous with other Identitarians while in Europe, he proudly added IDC’s logo to a wall of nationalist stickers, and postered unknown streets with signs reading “Plant more trees, save the seas, deport refugees.”

An actual critique of Canada ID, a group I was once affiliated with, would point out that the posters they put up, far from "muh hate," are actually bad just because they're poorly written, and frankly, downright cringey. Our enemies call themselves Xir and Xor, and some of the posters they wanted me to put up were so bad that, had I put them up, normal people would have thought us the weirdos. The above slogan is an exception, and something I could see myself putting up, so good on Canada ID for going with that.

One example of what was is actually imperfect with Canada ID can be found implicitly in this very article.

Alpine/Thor indicated at various points he was being pressured by Faith Goldy, Canadian Infidels, and SWCiv to put up posters imitating anti-fascist symbols with offensive messaging in an attempt to smear them.

This is basically retarded. What gets people in to our thing, is exposure to Anti-Whitism and Pervertism in the nude, so to speak. Instead of some fake shit that you can put up, allowing the enemy to then call any real missteps of theirs fake, you could just, you know, put up posters showing regular people what these people are getting up to.

The above two images are from the University of British Columbia's "Social Justice Institute". The next is a book by Harsha Walia, a Brown Globalist/Anti-White who is somewhat based in Burnaby. The next is from America, but we have similar. The next is Jagmeet Singh, NDP leader. The last is from the UBC Black Student Union. It took me 2 minutes to look through my picture folder from articles I had already written in order to find these. Putting these up in public with a "CANADA ID.com" tag, would do far more to get people on our side than any Pro-White Propaganda, since people are more motivated by attacks on White People than "hey White People are good," posters.

And no, you don't need to paraphrase these people. You don't need to summarize. What comes out of their mouths is bad enough verboten, and part of the propaganda is to simply not talk about things that Globo Homo Schlomo would rather you not talk about. They don't want people talking about the UBC Black Student Union "Challenging Whiteness," so... talk about it.
