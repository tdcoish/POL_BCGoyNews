Covid-19 is estimated to have triggered the worst global slump since the Great Depression and has already cost millions of working people their jobs.

Billionaires however have cashed in as their enormous fortunes bloated as much of the world was in lockdown, according to a new report by Swiss bank UBS.
Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, already the world's richest man, increased his wealth by £57billion and is now estimated to be worth up to £146billion.
Meanwhile, Tesla and SpaceX boss Elon Musk saw the biggest boon as he saw his fortune swell to £58billion to an estimated nearly £80billion.
The number of billionaires also reached a new high, rising from 2,158 to 2,189 as the wealthy benefited from the recovery of crashing stock markets during lockdown.

Billionaires fortunes have almost doubled in the past three years as the world appears to be entering a new Gilded Age.
The Gilded Age was a period of rapid wealth accumulation by a small number of wealthy US families at the beginning of the 20th century.
It represented largest concentration of wealth by such few people in history, and Mr Stadler said the world is on the verge of seeing such a divide again.
Mr Stadler explained billionaires have been able to weather the coronavirus storm as they had "the stomach" to buy more shares as global stocks crashed.
And as the world enters a recovery period after the first wave of the pandemic, the billionaires'' "significant risk appetite" paid off and they cashed in.

Alright stop. No it’s not because they have “significant risk appetite,” you fucking shill. The reason that Jeff Bezos has gotten so much richer is that the lockdowns have destroyed the small, local businesses that competed against him, many of which have been outright destroyed. The reason why people are selling stock is because they are having their livelihoods destroyed, and are being made poorer, not because of “significant risk appetite”. So billionaires are running companies that aren’t affected, or see their competition negatively affected, but then get to use their stolen wealth to purchase up the assets of middle class peasants desperate to sell to pay their mortgage.
Fuck billionaires and fuck the propagandists who defend them.

The banker has previously warned the widening gulf in inequality could lead the poor to "strike back".
Speaking in 2017, he told The Guardian: "We’re at an inflection point. Wealth concentration is as high as in 1905, this is something billionaires are concerned about.
"The problem is the power of interest on interest – that makes big money bigger and, the question is to what extent is that sustainable and at what point will society intervene and strike back?”
He warned there is the risk of political and public anger over the billionaires' extraordinary fortunes as millions continue to struggle.

Okay here we see the point. He’s trying to do this whole “well we’ve stolen a lot of the peasants money. That’s fine in and of itself, but if they stop doing fake and gay Economic Leftism there’s really nothing stopping them from putting my masters heads on sticks. Since millennials are so poor, there’s really nothing stopping them from just doing this to us.” 
This is of course a legitimate concern of theirs, and rightfully so.

Luke Hilyard, executive director of the High Pay Centre, a think tank that looks at excessive pay,  said the swelling wealth was a sign "capitalism isn't working".
He said: "Billionaire wealth equates to a fortune almost impossible to spend over multiple lifetimes of absolute luxury.
"Anyone accumulating riches on this scale could easily afford to raise the pay of the employees who generate their wealth, or contribute a great deal more in taxes to support vital public services, while remaining very well rewarded for whatever successes they’ve achieved."
He added: "Extreme wealth concentration is an ugly phenomenon from a moral perspective, but it’s also economically and socially destructive."

Okay, this is a little bit more like it. Historically the way they’ve destroyed anti-billionaire movements was by intentionally conflating the 0.0001% with the top 50% of earners. That’s why you see Marxists demanding that the income tax be raised, despite the income tax being a tax on workers by definition. That’s also why you will never see a Marxist or E-Leftist, or whomever, proposing a billionaire tax, where their wealth is simply confiscated. The goal is to intentionally get rejected from average everyday people and try to be as unpopular as possible.
Focusing purely on how these billionaires could simply give their employees, who actually produce the wealth, higher wages is a very good start. However, this is still designed to fail. It’s not that Jeff Bezos doesn’t understand that he could pay his workers more, he destroys their wages as a matter of pride. He’s a malicious little manlet. 
What gets people really motivated is pointing out that these billionaires buy politicians. That they flood your country with Somalis. They support “diversity,” initiatives and trannies. They do all this because they are malicious. Jeff Bezos enjoys doing things to you that you hate, because it makes him feel powerful and in charge. This gets him implicitly revenge against all those jocks who made fun of him all his life for being short and unbearably weird looking. It’s no different than having a boss who fucks with you just because they can.

The UBS report said that some billionaires had donated some of their wealth to help deal with the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic.
It read: "Our research has identified 209 billionaires who have publicly committed a total equivalent to $7.2bn from March to June 2020.
"They have reacted quickly, in a way that’s akin to disaster relief, providing unrestricted grants to allow grantees to decide how best to use funds."
The research shows that UK billionaires donated much less than those from other countries - donating just £298million.

Really interesting how this article tries to finish on a high note, at least a perceived high note, on behalf of the billionaires. “Oh you see you silly goyim, a tiny percentage of billionaires have donated less than 0.1% of their total stolen wealth to you filthy peasants. That makes up for them stealing your assets at deprecated valuation.”
