<a href="../Articles/CNP_TravisPatronArrested.html">In my article on Travis Patron's incarceration by the RCMP,</a> I noted that Patron is kind of not telling the whole story when he does his whole "no lawful charges have been laid against me," routine. I can't stress enough, I completely support Patron in fighting back against his persecution, but it's just kind of frustrating how he insists on pretending that he was just thrown in jail for no reason. I mean, he was thrown in jail for no GOOD reason, not no reason at all.

The leader of the Nationalist Party of Canada has found himself in boiling hot water after making remarks about the Jewish community in posts on social media. Because of those posts, Patron now has one particular human right's group looking to get the law involved siting hate speech. 

Jaime Kirzner-Roberts is the director for the campaign against antisemitism with the Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center or FSWC. Their goal is to seek out hatred and bigotry towards the Jewish community and to intervene and put a stop to it. They have been doing this for many years and have even helped find escaped Nazis around the world from the second world war to date.

Sidenote. What the fuck is wrong with her jewface? I know that jews suffer from inbreeding like nobodies business, but wow. And the best part is that this must have been her best take. All the other pictures they took of her had to have been worse than this, and her eyes aren't even looking in the same direction. One of the most disgusting lopsided faces I have ever seen. 

SAD!

Back to our story.

Ah yes, the Jew Supremacist goal of hunting down 95 year old secretaries who might have at one point been drafted into duty in the German Army. No, goy, they don't bother hunting down 95 year old Jew Communists who squealed with joy while they starved millions of filthy Ukranian Goyim to death. To do so would be a (((human rights violation))), or something.

And yes, Simon Wiesenthal Centre is a Jew Nationalist organization, goy. Don't think that they support Palestinian Goyim responding to actual oppression from Jews.

Kirzner-Roberts is appalled by the rhetoric Patron is spreading and said up to this point he had been using tactics to avoid flat out targeting Jews. She explained some of the strategies they take to avoid consequences on a technicality.

"One thing that he's been doing, which is a common thing that we see among far-right extremists and white supremacists groups is that they speak in euphemisms about Jewish people and others. On many of his statements he was saying, 'they are invaders, they are controlling the media, they are controlling the banks,' or referring to Jews as the Synagogue of Satan."

I mean, talking about the "Synagogue of Satan," is pretty much just flat out talking about jews right? Not sure why this Schlomo-ette decided to include that. Examples of real jewphemisms. "I am getting tired of these hook nosed financiers, these curly haired merchants, these beady eyed pornographers," etcetera.
"No I swear to god, I had no idea that 'synagogue of satan,' was refering to jews," said no one ever.

She points out that everyone knows who he is referring to when he speaks in this matter. He had always avoided using the word Jew until last weekend when he published a new pamphlet/flyer in which he specifically referred to Jews as 'being a part of a parasitic tribe.' As soon as the FSWC was made aware of the post they notified authorities.

Luckily for Travis Patron, the truth is a defense. Unluckily for Travis Patron, kikes. To expand on that last point, I don't have any faith in the legal system to hear arguments about jews being responsible for usury, or Israel sucking up foreign aid, or whatever actual legal argument Patron is going to try to make. Frankly, I don't have any faith that Patron is going to make any legal argument at all, to be completely honest, since he doesn't appear to think that the charges against him are lawful.

Kirzner-Roberts said that even more disturbing is the fact that antisemitism and the prevalence of white nationalist and extremist groups are on the rise.

The above picture is the picture of Jamie Kirzner-Roberts. It is also a picture of a Jew Nationalist, who supports the "no goyim allowed," policy of the Jew Ethnostate of Occupied Palestine. This Jew Nationalist is "disturbed," by the prevalence of "White Nationalist," groups. I'm going to repeat that Whitey. This jew nationalist is disturbed by White Nationalists. 
Jew Nationalist. 
White Nationalist.

The rest of the article is just classic "muh poysecution," "muh hate crimes," "muh Lampshadocaust". It never ends with these so-called people.
