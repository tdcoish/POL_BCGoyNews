I recently got a year older, and this caused me to reflect on the utterly wasted year that I had at age 28. 

- COVID bullshit caused PPBC to die on the vine.
- PPC is kind of a LOLbert operation.
- NDP bullshit called election a year early.
- As a result, next BC election is four fucking years away.

People don't need yet another news blog. People don't need yet another effort post essay. People don't need edutainment. People don't need to be more educated, they need advocacy. I am really fucking tired of online echo chamber bullshit. I am really fucking tired of this shit. I don't fucking care about faggots who go on endlessly about "opsec," and other bullshit, and then never actually fucking do anything. I am beyond tired of this shit. Either start an actually active political party that does things, or shut the fuck up.

There is this one really annoying streak of faggottry that runs throughout dissident politics. That's the "opsec" faggot, who never actually does any fucking ops. It's the "we can't do x, because then system something something." Okay, maybe grow some balls and then do x anyway you faggot. When I started the PPBC, I had some faggot on BANG say something like "if this LARP ever gets off the ground the feds are gonna look up your post history." 

Okay... so? I'm sorry faggot, but there's no song and dance that's gonna keep you out of prison. What will keep you out of prison is me and 10,000 other goyim showing up and bringing you out. On top of that, we have orphaned 2 year old children being abused by HIV positive faggots in the BC provincial government. I give zero fucks about the wellbeing of faggots who are more concerned that they might go to jail, than putting an end to that. Sorry, don't care.

There is this idea that the absolute worst a political movement can do is to not obey the song and dance provided and thread the needle with imaginary optics. No, the worst that a political movement can do is be so concerned with not going to jail that normies look at it and say "these faggots never do anything, why should I care?" Normies are just people who aren't constantly online, and they have a very good sense of when something actually real is happening. Normies loved Trump up until 2018 or so, then they just went back to doing whatever they felt like, because they could see how utterly fake Trump was, even if they couldn't explain it.

And frankly, I'm starting to get there myself. Either fucking do something or explain to me why I should give a shit.
