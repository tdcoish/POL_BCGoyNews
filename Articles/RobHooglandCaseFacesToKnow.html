This article will be a quick explanation of who's who in the legal battle by Rob Hoogland for the future of his child.
<img src="../Images/robHooglandWithDaughter.jpg">
Rob Hoogland.
The father of the abused child. He's been trying to get his daughter saved from mutilation. Unfortunately, he has failed. The state has already put the child on "puberty blockers," as well as massive amounts of testosterone. I mean Bodybuilder going for competition levels of testosterone. The child is now sterile. Rob fights to try to make sure this doesn't happen to other children.

Carey Linde.
Hero lawyer taking the case for Rob Hoogland pro bono. He's got a vague history of being a men's rights activist, which is not surprising considering he's in family law. He runs a divorce law for men practice.

Wallace Wong.
HIV Positive Sodomite who's wormed his way into an important position in the BC provincial governments Ministry of Children and Family Development. By his own account, he diagnoses 10-20% of all the orphaned children in his "care" as being "gender dysphoric," that is to say, the wrong sex. He then tells them to make a "social transition," until the age of 13, when they are then told to go on sterilizing hormones. He told the daughter, who was in elementary school at the time, that she was a boy, hid this from the father, who found out in a school yearbook.

Barbara Findley.
She's the lawyer "for" the daughter. Insane lady, writes her name all in lower case letters. Like, this bitch is fucking insane. Also you see her in interviews, and she is the caricature of the nasty anti-normal lesbian. The type of person who gets me very excited. The type of person to make me understand why we need anti-normal hate speech laws protecting average everyday people from the insane like this.

Brenden Hursh.
Doctor at the BC Children's Hospital. Administers cross-sex hormones to children. Basically the guy directly responsible for the mutilation of children. I mean, look at his face.
<img src="../Images/francescaMarzari.jpg">
"Justice" Francesca Marzari. 
She's a hardcore "intersectional" feminist who used to serve with the West Coast LEAF organization. She's been tormenting Hoogland for protecting his daughter, and has at least warned him once of committing "family violence" by "misgendering" his daughter. Family violence laws exist to protect children from actual physical beatings.

"Justice" Michael Tammen.
Another shitbag judge. They all are. Reprimanded Hoogland for referring to his daughter as his daughter. Ordered that the media, Hoogland, or anyone else be not allowed to share the names of doctors or counselors, or even Hoogland's name. Has also ordered the man back into court for our upcoming April 12th trial, because he referred to his daughter as "she". 

There are many more names, although these are the most important ones. I will add to the list as it becomes more important.
