In my <a href="../Articles/.html">article</a> that I wrote a few weeks ago now, I detailed how a few "Canadian" Schlomo's were forced by a Polish Court to apologize to a Polish Woman who had her uncle slandered by them. At the time I wrote it, I noticed that there was this really weird inclusion in the propaganda piece I was basing my story off of. These institutions of Schlomo included "Calin Rovinescu," as one of the "omfg my pussy has been violated by the Poles not letting jews slander the Goyim," whiners in the piece. 
<img src="../Images/calinRovinescu.jpg"><figcaption>Calin Rovinescu</figcaption>
I thought this was somewhat weird, since I went to Wikipedia, smashed that Early Life, and didn't see anything like "Calin slithered out of a heeb pussy hungry for Goy blood," or something similar. It did appear somewhat odd that they would mention this "Romanian Immigrant," and the guy struck me as being kind of weird, so I looked into him again today. What I found may or may not be a Schlomo, but is one of the best examples of a "Parasitical Internationalist."

What could someone possibly do in order to receive not one, not two, but six "honorary doctorates"? How is this even possible? Well, decided to find out. I clicked on the links provided, and was brought to this University of Ottawa Page. The U of Montreal had a 404 error.

Alumnus Calin Rovinescu's distinguished career in corporate law, as a managing partner with Stikeman Elliott, and in business, as cofounder of Genuity Capital Markets, served him well when he became President and CEO of Air Canada in 2009.

Under his leadership, and during a time of economic turbulence, he piloted the company's rise from the brink of bankruptcy to soaring profitability while eliminating the significant drag of its $3.7 B pension plan deficit. As a result, in 2013, he was named Canada's best CEO by Report on Business.

Aca-Scuse me? This guy is being celebrated for "eliminating the drag of 3.7B pension plan deficit." What exactly does that mean? Did this guy just... destroy the pensions of thousands of Air Canada Employees? This is... something to celebrate? He needs to be awarded honorary law degrees for this?

Apparently not. I can't find anything but a puff piece, but they all seem to say that he simply made the company profitable enough to have the pensions solvent again. If so, fine. Taking into account that this guy was a managing partner with the 300+ million yearly revenues Stikeman Elliot, and founded an investment bank, Genuity Capital Markets, I'd say much healty skepticism is warranted.

Oh and don't worry goy, we'll get to "Stikeman Elliot," in another full article. You'd be astonished at how rich these law firms are.

And there is no doubt in my mind that these three words were not only relevant over the past three decades, but are all the more relevant as you are about to embark on your careers in this stimulating, but hyper-competitive, global world where innovation, risk and speed have a much greater advantage than ever over “the way we always did things”.

These three words are:
knowledge;
courage; and
mindfulness.

The above is from his "acceptance" speech, or whatever you'd call his "thank you for this honorary degree UOttawa!" speech. I was going to print the rest, but oh my fucking god is it every tedious. I read the first part, and then I honestly couldn't even bear to skim the rest. It's just so tedious. I mean listen to this.

So my first message to you is that, one way or another, you need to develop, to nurture and to feed your voracious appetite for knowledge conventionally or unconventionally. And to satisfy that appetite, you will generally need the help of others. I can guarantee you that every person you will meet on this planet will know something you don’t, and it’s up to you to find out what that is.

What I most certainly did not find out is why the hell this guy is being given an honorary doctorate degree from U of Ottawa. But really, who cares? After all, we've got four more to go, let's see what Concordia University gave him his honorary doctorate for.

Apparently he's just an "inspired leader in the aviation industry." This is the reason that they give him an honorary doctorate. In case you're wondering why this is so disgusting, let me introduce you to the other 3 people Concordia gave honorary doctorates to alongside him.

There are many times that I am honestly baffled by these people. Like, they're so ridiculous that I temporarily forget how evil they are. Getting an honorary doctorate for your commitment to Haiti, and your impact on the "international music scene." What dipshit thought this was a good idea?

Ah yes. Chassagne was a pallet cleanser, a bit of comedic relief. This fucking cunt, I swear to god. As is often the case, you do a little investigation into these people, and suddenly you're twenty organizations deep, uncovering this spiraling well of Globo Homo Schlomo. However, I think her little blurb should give you the general idea, we all know the archetype.

Next up we have the University of Windsor, and oh my fucking god now I have to print out the blurbs for all these shitbags as well.

Again, we all know the archetype. Being recognized by dysgenic rat faced White People, and Schlomo for decades of anti-White activism, which you probably, one way or another, paid for. Useless eater. Bad Poetry. The type of black to wear a non-functioning scarf.

Lawyer who does legal anti-White action. Also, "reproductive rights," sounds like codeword for "murder as many babies as possible." She's at a university near me, so maybe I'll go and check this broad out. I checked her out online and my biases were indeed confirmed.

Alright, I'm not going to go over the others. Some of them seemed fine, like one doctor who made scientific advancements in bleeding diseases. 

I'm also going to skip going into detail about "Pepperdine Unversity," or "Politehnica University of Bucharest," because the first just has a blurb about everyone saying "we really value business achievements blah blah," and the second is, after I hit Google Translate, literally the exact same shit as all the others. "This dude Air Canada turnaround blah blah here's a doctorate." Anyway, I even went to click the link to the University of Montreal website, but that gave me a 404 error.

So yes, this guy allegedly did moderately well when taking over Air Canada. I might remind everyone, that he took over Air Canada in 2008, during the Great Recession, and when air travel was at its lowest. A guy who literally did nothing could have at least turned the company around somewhat, and I highly doubt this career parasite was adding much value. But I haven't even gotten into the guys actual career, and Wikipedia just flat out skips this massive part of his life until he's somehow a managing partner in a major 300+ Million dollar per year law firm.

So, this guy has been getting some massive nepotism his entire life. He literally started his own investment bank (with who's money, goy?), jumped to the top of Air Canada, and now has six universities giving him honorary doctorates. And oh my god, feel free to skim this next part, but the list of awards this faggot has won is beyond tedious. As is the boards he "serves" on.

He also serves on the board of directors of BCE Inc., Canada's largest telecom and media company as well as on the board of directors[16] of the Business Council of Canada (BCC), an organization composed of the CEOs of Canada's largest enterprises, representing all sectors of the Canadian economy.

The Globe and Mail's Report on Business magazine named Rovinescu Canada's best CEO of 2013 and again in 2019, the only two-time winner of this award. In addition, in 2016, he was named Canada's Outstanding CEO of the Year by Financial Post Magazine, the country's preeminent award for chief executives, founded in 1990 to identify and recognize exemplary leadership and achievement in business.

In 2018, Flight Global presented Rovinescu with the Global Executive Leadership Award at the 2018 Airline Strategy Awards in London, England, the airline industry’s leading recognition for CEOs of global carriers. He was recognized for his "strong and unwavering leadership of Air Canada."

Also in 2018, Rovinescu was recognized with the CEO lifetime achievement Award at the Airline Passenger Experience Association (APEX) expo in Boston, and named the first CEO from the Americas to be presented with the Award by APEX.

In 2019, Tourisme Montreal presented Rovinescu with their highest honour, the Tribute Award, for his contribution to the development of Montreal and the Conseil du Patronat inducted him into its Entrepreneurs’ Club, amongst the significant leaders of Quebec business. Also in December 2019, it was announced that he would be inducted as a Companion into the Canadian Business Hall of Fame.

On October 3, 2019, together with his wife Elaine, he announced the creation of the Rovinescu Admission Scholarships for new Canadians, to benefit students at both the University of Ottawa and Université de Montréal through a gift of $2M, to be divided equally between the two institutions. The Rovinescu Scholarships will provide first-generation Canadians or children of immigrants, with the opportunity to pursue a bachelor’s or professional degree designation at either university.

Since November 9, 2015, he was named 14th Chancellor of the University of Ottawa, replacing former Governor General Michaëlle Jean.

Rovinescu was appointed a member of the Order of Canada for promoting the associated charitable causes and organizations of Canada's largest airline, and for his leadership in spearheading humanitarian relief following several natural disasters.
