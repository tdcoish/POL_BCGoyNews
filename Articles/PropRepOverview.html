This is part of a series of articles I'm writing on Proportional Representation, culminating in the completely fake and gay NDP throwing the fight on the last referendum, held in 2018. Before I can get into that particular story, I felt I needed to give an overview on what Proportional Representation is, and what it means for us. Why would anyone want something other than the First Past the Post System that we have now?

Well the answer is pretty simple: the First Past the Post System, or FPP, gives a massive advantage to parties for... being successful, in and of itself. On the face of it, that doesn't sound wrong, after all, if the parties are popular, then they deserve success. And this would be true, but a more accurate way to describe the parties would be viable. Voting for a party that does not have a lot of funding, or gets extremely unfavourable media coverage, can be a waste of time. If the party does not have a chance at winning, then you are throwing your vote away. As a result, parties in such a system do not need to do jack shit for the people, because their competitors do not have viability. 

While it is true that other political parties have come and gone right here in BC, such as the now non-existant Social Credit Party, the immediate lack of "viability," is what dooms many upstart parties. Well, that and actual oppression by the system, such as the Gay-Op's we faced at Charlottesville. On the federal level, we can see that we have two "right wing" parties, the Conservative Party of Canada, and the People's Party of Canada. While Bernier is essentially a LOLbertarian, he is at least an honest guy, which is why he had the CPC leadership race stolen from him by Andrew Scheer's backers. The PPC got just 1.62% of the vote last election, while the CPC got 34.34% of the vote. I don't know a single CPC voter who legitimately wanted the CPC to win over the PPC, yet because the PPC is considered unviable, they strategically vote for the CPC.

To sum it up. First Past the Post encourages the oppressed peasants to vote strategically for parties they hate, because they hate them slightly less than the other party. Existing Big/Donor-Controlled-Parties, can always laugh at the peasants with a "who else can you vote for," line. Prop Rep aims to destroy this, by destroying the entire concept of Strategic Voting.

However, there is one very obvious drawback to the most straightforwards Prop Rep Solution. What we could do is entirely scrap the regional membership part, and just let people vote for parties. Then, in legislature, there could be 100 seats, or 1,000, the number doesn't really matter, divided amongst the parties based on the votes they accrued. So if the NDP got 33% of the vote, they get 33 seats. If the BC Liberal Party gets 27% of the vote, they get 27 seats. And if the National Justice Party gets 14% of the vote, they get 14 seats, and so on. Who gets to actually sit in those seats would be decided by the party higherups.

All of this means that people do not have to vote strategically for a party, since any party that gets more than 1% of the vote, has legitimacy. However, it also means they do not get a regional representative, and therefore do not have someone to call and bitch to directly. I don't think that's all that relevant, but it's a thing some people care about. More importantly, any independent who gets blackballed by the established parties and decides to run in their area, is basically out of luck, since their local votes don't matter any more than votes elsewhere in the province. 

Technically, it also "gives party insiders more power," since they now get to pick who sits in those seats after the election, not before. So they could theoretically put some convicted terrorist in a seat. This, again, does not seem all that important to me, considering that Canadian Parties do not have a primary system, so all that changes is that they pick the candidates before the election, not after. However, this could matter to some people. Remember though, it's easier to destroy parties, so they have much more incentive to not do things like that in the first place.

So the upside is that small parties with grassroots support have electoral viability, almost immediately, and established parties can be much more easily destroyed. It also will bring many people who have given up on voting back, because their vote truly matters. The downside is that Independents are basically hopeless, Party Insiders control who sits in those seats after the elections, and you don't get a Regional Representative. Those may be minor downsides, but they are not nothing, which is why the best system is a simple hybrid of the two. 

In what's called Mixed-Member Proportional, people effectively get to do both. You vote for a candidate in your region, just like currently. However, you get a second vote for a political party. In congress, there are two types of seats, the directly elected seats, and the party-elected seats. I will call the latter Percentage Seats, to make it less confusing. As a result of this, you retain the best of First Past the Post, mostly having a real representative, as well as having the ability to vote for a small political party, and knowing that your vote matters. While it is true that you would still potentially need to vote strategically for an unpopular candidate, since small parties can enter the Percentage Seats much more easily, they can make a much better case for their importance, and therefore viability in any particular race. As a result, it should be much easier to quickly destroy and remove Established Parties, ensuring they actually serve the needs of the people, as well as still having your local representative, and not being ruled over by urbanites.

However, a very quick note. Under no circumstances should we go the route of Germany. They have this system, but with one poison pill: parties must get at least 5% of the vote in order to get representation. This is 100% the worst of all worlds. Having a cut off of, say, 1% is fine, for administrative purposes. Having a cutoff of 5% exists only to destroy the entire point, which is small political parties who actually serve the people, but aren't immediately popular.

One crucial exception to Germanyâ€™s system of personalized proportional representation is the so-called 5 percent clause. The electoral law stipulates that a party must receive a minimum of 5 percent of the national vote, or three constituency seats, in order to get any representation in the Bundestag. An exception was made for the first all-Germany election in December 1990, with the Federal Constitutional Court setting separate 5 percent minimums for the old and new Laender . Thus, a party needed only to win 5 percent of the vote in either western or eastern Germany in order to receive seats in the Bundestag.

The 5 percent clause was crafted to prevent the proliferation of small extremist parties like those that destabilized the Weimar Republic. This electoral hurdle has limited the success of minor parties and consolidated the party system. Often voters are reluctant to vote for a smaller party if they are unsure if it will clear the 5 percent threshold. Smaller parties, such as the FDP, encourage voters to split their ticket, casting their first ballot for a named candidate of one of the larger parties and their second ballot for the FDP.

Other than this pretty much explicitly anti-democratic rule, this is the ideal system.

As far as we're concerned, I actually don't think it's all that important. We are in a fairly unique position, because our vote is very much not spread out throughout the country, but rather in demographic hotspots. If we can get just 10% support throughout Canada, or some province, this could easily be enough to pick up a few seats in heavily rural, heavily White areas, since our support there could easily be 30+%. In contrast, in Urban areas we could easily be getting less than 1% of the vote. So for us, this is not the end of the world, and in fact if we can show the CPC, or whatever Donor-Right Party that stands in our way to be unviable, then everyone will go with us, and we can have success faster than you would realize.

So basically, in the short term, Mixed-Member Proportional would be the ideal system, since we could get into parliament in Percentage Seats, at even around 2% of the vote, become more legitimate, and work our way from there. Long term our strategy is to destroy the CPC, which will give us all of their strategic voters. Once we become seen as viable, then this system does nothing for us, since we actually benefit from Urbanites being concentrated all in one place. 

More importantly, Mixed-Member Proportional will never happen, because the existing Donor-Controlled-Parties, have absolutely zero incentive to put in a system that would ensure their destruction. They are aware of how hated they are, and aren't about to do something that would destroy them. We'll see a great example of this tomorrow when I get into how the NDP threw the fight on this issue.
