Well goyim, we're back again with yet another tired, boring take on the future of the BC Liberal Party. This one is from a guy named Justin "Drex" Wilcomes, an Aussie transplant, who worked a few radio talk shows here in Canada. Apparently Wilcomes had a reputation for being somewhat "politically incorrect," but everything I've seen of him translates that into "will give you the Donor Approved Line, while not being a Lisping Faggot." Also, he has a horrible voice for radio. Just sayin.

I’ve always thought journalists who enter politics are sellouts. When Steve Darling went into politics I was one of many who rolled my eyes…hard.

But Jas Johal is honestly the only guy that could change my opinion on that, and it’s for that reason he should be the next leader of the BC Liberals.

Wait, what? Jas Johal? He's a former MLA for a reason, and that reason is that he lost his seat to the NDP candidate. So he's an unpopular loser.
TDC_ARTICLE_START
Jas started his career as a reporter at 980 CKNW, followed by 11 years as a reporter at BCTV. He then went international, covering some of the biggest stories across the planet from Southeast Asia to China. The guy has seen the daily struggles of Canadians and the world over.

He’s seen the shit people wade through every day just to live. And he’s reported on it to the country.

Apparently being in India and China covering daily news stories and then broadcasting those stories to Canadians qualifies him to lead the BC Liberal Party. I mean, that's actually 100% true, but that also disqualifies him from being someone who the common man is going to look to as a legitimate leader. I think I speak for 90% of the population when I say that some International Journalist is easily in the bottom 1% of people who I want leading my political party.
TDC_ARTICLE_START
Reporters live everyone else’s drama, daily. Whether a family losing everything to a fire, or a Vancouver business shutting up shop and firing thousands, as a journalist, Johal had a front seat to what some of us may call hell.

Isn’t that what you want your politician to know? Your everyday struggles? So they can help makes changes for the better?

The answer is yes.

Well I mean people do want politicians to know people's everyday struggles, and an international journalist ain't it. Jas Johal is in the Propaganda Class, a man who exists to serve the privileged and powerful, and whether or not the average person can articulate their feelings towards him, they do not want him in any way shape or form.

Christy Clark was all over politics early, which in some ways could have clouded seeing the everyday. Wilkinson is a doctor and lawyer, well educated, but aloof as hell. He didn’t show much personality, and people don’t like drones.

But Johal, he’s fresh. He’s only a few years in. And he knows our stories. All of them. And he ain’t as tainted yet.

That’s crucial, because the BC Liberals really need to freshen things up. Their position on LGBTQ+ issues has been tacky, and on “real estate” (which we call housing) out of touch.

I’ve met amazing young members of the BC Liberals who’ve tried their hand at politics here and there, and volunteered on campaigns. God, even some of them likely showed Mike de Jong how to send emails. And those folks likely have fresh ideas they’d love to bring to the table.

I know that Jas Johal is one of those guys. Know how I know? Journalists inherently give a shit. It’s that simple really. They never lose it.

God this guy is a total queer. This is the only article he has on The Orca, and I'm going to assume he got paid to write this, which illustrates one of the most valid reasons to hate "Journalists," they are sponsored content. Wilcomes doesn't tell you who writes his cheques, but it's someone, and that someone isn't average everyday people. I assure you of that, goy.

True, some get big jobs, get paid too much and lose some touch with reality. But people who remain reporters for so long are addicted to life in the trenches. Telling peoples stories of misery while in many cases not making their own ends meet. Because if you didn’t know, folks, most journalists get paid garbage.

Journalists inherently give a shit.
TDC_ARTICLE_STOP
<img src="../Images/memeFactCheckFalse2.png">
Journalists put up with garbage pay because they enjoy being the propagandists of the privileged and powerful. They enjoy being able to lie to the public, and then laugh at the impotent disorganized peasant response. They're like some sadistic cop, who "gets," to beat the peasants when they misbehave. The Middle Managers of Your Oppression.

And they get shit pay, because they are totally replaceable. Their shit pay in fact, shows them to be more likely to toe the line, rather than less likely, because it shows their inherent lack of worth. If they were really talented and important, they would be compensated accordingly. As it is, anyone who is evil and intelligent goes into finance, where you can make lots more money fucking over the little people.

It appears for now, Johal may have lost his Richmond-Queensborough riding by just a few hundred votes. But his concession & extremely congratulatory thread of tweets to John Horgan & presumptive NDP MLA Aman Singh really speaks volumes about what this guy wants to do.

Agreeing with Propagandists for the wrong reasons. Here's a picture of Aman Singh on the right, with Jas Johal on the left.

Do you notice anything here, goy? Yes, that's right, they're both brown. So what's really going on is that Jas Johal, who can be quoted as wanting the party moving in a Socially Liberal fashion, read: anti-white + pro-pervert, is happy that some other brown guy won the election. Considering that there isn't really any distance between him and the NDP, it's possible he's going to outright make a transition to the NDP himself. If not, he'll try to get control of the BC Liberal Party and steer it in a more anti-White direction.

Cynics will simply see it as PR spin, and look, I’m usually the chief cynic when it comes to the BC Liberals. But I believe he’s been genuine.

He already knows the changes that need to be made within the party to bring them into the present. And that’s why he should take on the big job…if he even wants it. I suspect he does.
TDC_ARTICLE_STOP
I suspect that you would not be writing this puff piece if you didn't already know that Mr. Johal wanted the job, Mr. Wilcomes. I suspect that quite strongly.
