<a href="../Articles/SterrittAbosWhining.html">Yesterday</a> I went through the Angela Sterritt twitter thread, went down the rabbit hole a little bit, and came across a story where some Abos got fired for some "bullshit" reasons. My suspicion was that they were Abo'ing it up, but I got a link to the petition on Change.Org to allow them to keep their jobs.

The Indigenous Health and Wellness Workers at St Paul's Hospital were recently told at a meeting that the Indigenous Health Worker positions were being dissolved/displaced in a very colonial/underhanded manner with no union representation.

I didn't make that up. That's a quote. "In a very colonial/underhanded manner."

Our Indigenous community needs these Indigenous service providers in place. It’s something central to their well-being and it’s also important for the community to be working with staff who are actually embedded in Indigenous practice as a part of their daily life.

Providence was supposed to be working towards providing culturally safe acute and outpatient care across all services and programs.  How does dissolving an existing team known and trusted in community help achieve these goals?

First, St. Paul's hospital is in Downtown Vancouver. How many Abos live in Downtown Vancouver? This isn't some hospital in Northern BC, these were a bunch of rent-seeker parasites getting a check that your taxes paid for in order to at best be innocuous and useless, and at worst push an anti-White agenda.

Second, I just can't help but laugh. "Culturally safe acute and outpatient care." WTF does that even mean? I change my mind, at worst these Abos were getting in the way of actual doctors and nurses trying to provide real care for people with their "culturally safe" horseshit.

And no, I still haven't figured out who METL is.
