This story needs a quick introduction. Back in August of this year, the taxpayers of Victoria were bilked for $5,000 dollars in order for the “African Heritage Museum of Vancouver Island,” to produce a Mural. I couldn’t find a great image of the Mural, but this is the best I could find.

It reads “More Justice, More Peace,” which is a sort of psuedo-BLM slogan. A statement by the group responsible, said African Heritage Museum reads:

"The mural itself is impactful and whatever the outcome, we are glad that the mural will inspire, teach, provoke conversations and contribute to ongoing dialogue about systemic racism."

Inside the letter S, in the word “Justice,” was written the acronym ACAB, for All Cops Are Bad. It’s incredibly unclear whether said message was always in the mural, or appeared after one month, but in any case, once it appeared, the Victoria Police Department threw a little hissy fit over this and demanded it be removed. As an example from the <a href=" https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/city-sponsored-justice-awareness-mural-deeply-disrespectful-says-victoria-s-police-chief-1.5704566">CBC:</a>

"The matter at hand is not the mural," [Victoria Police Chief Del Manak] said in an interview. "It's a wonderful project that brought people together on an important topic. The matter to discuss, that we'll be discussing with them, is the inclusion of the acronym."

Alrighty. Then what happened was the Victoria City Government voted to remove this message, which they did. However, after this, a new message was written on the mural.

In its place, three eagle feathers have been painted above the letter with the following message listed underneath:
“This letter has been censored by the City of Victoria influenced by the Victoria Police Department. In doing so, Victoria is contributing to the silencing of Black and Indigenous voices and experiences across this land.”

Now, I don’t want to add too much commentary here, but really, you know the shot. Anyway, you should be caught up now. Here's what happened October 31st.

Victoria, BC – Officers are seeking a suspect and witnesses after the “More Justice, More Peace” mural in Bastion Square was marked with spray paint this morning.
Shortly after 10 a.m. this morning Patrol officers were called to Bastion Square for a report that a letter in the mural was recently vandalized with spray paint. Witnesses reported that the suspect arrived around 10 a.m. on a motorcycle. The man then sprayed over the letter in the mural which was recently updated with a statement from the artists. The suspect then left the area.
The suspect is described as an adult-aged Caucasian man, standing approximately five feet, eight inches tall, with a medium build. The suspect wore a multi-coloured motorcycle helmet, a blue vest overtop of a green sweater, and dark cargo pants. The suspect rode a red and white motorcycle.

So basically a white man is sick of this anti-whiteness, and decides to take justice into his own hands. Let me make this very clear, I’m on the other side of the straight, but if I had been there, I would have done exactly the same thing. I have nothing but good things to say about this man, and I think he should be an inspiration to us. Should anything happen to him, we need to be there for him. This is true even if he turns out to be not perfectly our guy. Imperfect minds of action are a million times more valuable than perfect minds of inaction.

This story was brought to me by one of our goys on twitter, and he brought up something that few people will immediately think of. The obvious question of “why were there multiple cameras from different angles all over this mural?” I encountered something extremely similar in my <a href="../Articles/WVPDGestureOfHate.html">“Skidmark of hate,”</a> article, and subsequent investigation. For those who haven’t seen that yet, please check that out, but the important takeaway is that the WVPD was almost certainly trying to catch some goy defacing a sign, and had set up multiple cameras looking over their rainbow decal in order to do so. 

The same energy is present here in this little operation. As of right now, this hasn’t really gone anywhere, although I would love to give a shout out to whomever this helmeted hero is. I will be calling the Victoria Police Department and asking them a few questions like I did with the WVPD, although this will be harder, since I am not physically in the area, and cannot inspect anything myself.
