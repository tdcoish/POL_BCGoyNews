This is something more of a teaser for the University of British Columbia's Social Justice Institute, or rather the takedown of them that I am working on. However, to get a deeper understanding of who these people are, and what they're all about, I've decided to show you their "SOCIAL JUSTICE INSTITUTE STATEMENT ON ANTI-BLACKNESS AND THE KILLING OF GEORGE FLOYD: BLACK LIVES MATTER"
And yes, that's all capitalized because their title is all capitalized. I have no idea why, other than this being written by a real KANG.

The Social Justice Institute at UBC stands firmly in solidarity with Black communities and with movements dedicated to racial justice and to struggles against racial capitalism, settler colonialism and white supremacy in their systemic, institutional, and everyday manifestations.

Racial Capitalism? Settler Colonialism?

Imagine a group of people so awful that you almost start to support capitalism again. Well, now you don't have to imagine anymore.

We join protestors, activists and community organizers all over the world in seeking justice for George Floyd, Tony McDade, Breonna Taylor, Nina Pop,David McAtee, Ahmaud Arbery, Adama Traore, D’Andre Campbell, Abdirahman Abdi, Andrew Loku, Regis Korchinski-Paquet and Samwel Uko, as well as many others, including those whose names have been actively erased from history. We recognize that their deaths constitute only a small portion of the large number of deaths enabled by institutionalized anti-Blackness in policing. There are many more, as anti-Black violence has a long and ongoing history and is an important part of an enduring system of white supremacy that also deploys the violence of settler colonial dispossession, Indigenous genocide, cisheteropatriarchy and racisms against people of colour.
TDC_ARTICLE_STOP
OMFG they literally used the term "cisheteropatriarchy" unironically.
<img src="../Images/laughMadMen.jpg">
Welp, anyway. As the voice of, uhm, the enduring system of white supremacy that also deploys the violence of settler colonial dispossession, Indigenous genocide, cisheteropatriarchy, and racisms against people of colour, I don't have much to add. I feel like these people could not possibly have described me better, and we're about to get a front row seat to the uncovering of my evil ideology.
TDC_ARTICLE_START
We reiterate what protestors, activists and community organizers have stated before, and continue to state: that anti-Blackness also dehumanizes, maims and kills in the form of not only policing, but also: disproportionate exposure to environmental harms; school-to-prison pipelines; global capitalist practices that extract Black people’s labour and resources; misogynistic and cisheteronormative violence that targets especially Black women and LGBTQ people; and border control policies and practices that maintain white supremacy, settler colonialism and imperialism. We also name the anti-Blackness of inaccessible and inequitable health care systems that neglect Black people, as evidenced in the disproportionate COVID-19 infections and deaths of Black people in Toronto, New York, Louisiana, the UK and other places globally. We also name anti-Blackness in urban planning and economic development practices that neglect Black community needs, and that actively erase Black people’s geographies and histories through gentrification and infrastructure development. Of the latter, we specifically identify Hogan’s Alley in Vancouver and Africville in Halifax as two examples of the razing of Black communities from Canadian cities in the name of the so-called “greater good”.
TDC_ARTICLE_STOP
Yeah, black people committing crimes and then going to jail == White People's fault. Pay no attention to the 19,000 White Women raped by blacks every year, according to the FBI. Pay no attention to all the White People victimized by blacks every year. When black people commit crimes, they're the REAL victims, because they then go to jail.
<img src="../Images/heyThatsMyBike.png">

And as far as "global capitalist practices that extract black people's labour and resources," yeah are we talking about a Basketball team or something? WTF black labour is there to extract, these people are massively disproportionately on welfare.

Oh, I actually wrote up the whole Hogan's Alley thing. <a href="../Articles/DemandsBlackOnlySpaces.html">Read it here.</a> The TL:DR is that Hogan's Alley was destroyed not for shits and gigs, but because they were building part of the water system there. So yeah, I'm pretty sure that razing down a shithole filled with Jeqeerus's in order to build the necessary infrastructure to allow literally millions of people access to clean running water is "for the greater good."

However, it would be hilarious to imagine a bunch of White Chads just burning that shit to the ground just for fun.

We in educational institutions have a lot of work to do to face up to and undo the anti-Blackness that is woven in the fabric of our workplaces. At UBC, and in other post-secondary institutions, anti-Blackness takes form not only in macro- and micro-aggressions, but also in inequitable hiring, retention and promotion practices; curricula and research that ignore and displace the work of Black thinkers and cultural producers; departmental and work cultures that disproportionately burden Black faculty, staff and students; and the uncritical mobilization of “free speech” to provide space and support for anti-Black, racist, Islamophobic, misogynistic, anti-trans, anti-Indigenous and homophobic speakers. Last year, when UBC hosted the Congress of the Humanities and Social Sciences, Shelby McPhee, a Black scholar of Political Science, was racially profiled by fellow conference attendees, which led to university police subjecting him to public interrogation. While institutions like UBC have made public proclamations of a commitment to equity and diversity, these ring hollow unless actionable strategies and practices, with leadership from Black UBC community members, are adopted to respond to anti-Blackness in hiring, teaching, research, policymaking, community engagement and administration. Without material shifts in how we at UBC do things, empty rhetorical invocations of a commitment to social justice only serve to mask entrenched and ongoing structures of violence and exclusion.

This shit's retarded, but it is genuinely funny that they called the cops on what of the blacks scheduled to talk at their own conference. I would have absolutely paid money to see that happen. That brief moment of reality intruding into their lives.
<img src="../Images/shelbyMcPhee.jpg"><figcaption>Shelby McPhee. Potential Laptop Thief?</figcaption>
Actually I looked that incident up, and it's even weirder than you think. Apparently someone claimed he had stolen their laptop and followed him around. The RCMP were called in and found ultimately that he hadn't stolen their laptop. But now I really have a burning desire to find out WTF happened at this Social Justice Conference, or whatever it was called.

The Social Justice Institute will continue to leverage our research, teaching, community engagement, cultural production and presence in decision-making spaces towards the creation of more socially just worlds in and beyond the University. We acknowledge that the scholarship, teaching and creative work of Black people have been and continue to be foundational to the feminist, queer, anti-racist and decolonial histories, knowledges and futures that inform the work that we do. We will center intersectional approaches to social justice and will name the exclusionary and dehumanizing histories and ongoing practices of scholarly communities to which we belong. We will press our institution, our networks, our communities and ourselves to be accountable to the social justice demands, visions and leadership of our Black colleagues, students, community partners and friends (see links below). We commit to supporting Black students, faculty, staff and community members by amplifying Black scholarship, activism and cultural production, and providing support to them in our corridors and classrooms. We call on our community members to support, if you are able, the efforts of community organizers, educators and activists not only financially, but also as allies and accomplices on the frontlines (see links below).

Well finally we're getting the historectimies that priviltagize the Laerned Experiences of Blackness of Colour. Queer Dehumanization and Histories of Persecutorial institutionalization will be forthwrited into the Dustbin of History.

We identify the following calls to action to the University of British Columbia, including within the Social Justice Institute:
• Redirect financial, human and infrastructural resources to support and enhance all aspects of Black UBC community members’ relationships with the university, including in research, teaching, administration, student life and community engagement
• Adopt university. faculty and departmental policies that specifically support the hiring of Black faculty members, staff, and research and teaching personnel
• Increase scholarships, bursaries and other forms of support for Black undergraduate and graduate students, and allocate financial resources to support Black-led student and community organizing at UBC
• Allocate resources to strengthen the University’s capacity to offer courses and programs and to support research in Black studies
• Review and improve existing support systems (such as, but not limited to student advising, career advising and accommodations) to ensure that they support Black people and other marginalized communities in intersectional anti-oppressive ways
• Develop mechanisms to enhance and support the presence of Black UBC community members in crucial decision-making bodies at UBC
• Investigate and implement alternatives to policing at the UBC campus

In solidarity,
The Institute for Gender, Race, Sexuality and Social Justice

The statement continues with a dive into the various organizations that they support. All of which deserve close scrutiny of course. However, I can tell you right now that most of this is ultra-low energy bullshit. Some of those links lead to dead pages, or pages that haven't been updated in years. 

We need to understand that these people are Vicious Clowns. Some people think of them just as Clowns, some just as Vicious. But we can't forget to have a good chuckle at these people, while not forgetting that great Sam Hyde quote.
