This is a story from all the way back in 2014-2018, where Trinity Western University in Langley, BC was finding their law program under attack by the Law Society of BC, the Law Society of Ontario, and the Nova Scotia Barristers Society. The organizations were attempting to have the Trinity Western University Law School Unaccredited. If the Law School became unaccredited, then the school becomes worthless, not because what it teaches isn't law, but because you aren't allowed to practice law without accreditation. 

The way this works in Canada is not national, with each province having its own governing bodies, which is why there were the three law societies trying to ban TWU students from practicing law. Well, to make a long story short.

A B.C.-based evangelical Christian university has lost its legal battle over accreditation for a planned new law school, with a Supreme Court of Canada ruling today saying it's "proportionate and reasonable" to limit religious rights in order to ensure open access for LGBT students.

In a pair of 7-2 rulings, the majority of justices found the law societies of British Columbia and Ontario have the power to refuse accreditation based on Trinity Western University's so-called community covenant.

These are the privileged cunts who the current system puts in place to rule over you. They all dress up like Santa Claus and that's not even the fifth worst thing about them.

The mandatory covenant binds students to a strict code of conduct that includes abstinence from sex outside of heterosexual marriage.

The majority judgment said the covenant would deter LGBT students from attending the proposed law school, and those who did attend would be at risk of significant harm.

It's amazing how stupid the oppression is. Apparently, not letting faggots buttfuck each other leads to them "being at risk of significant harm." To even respond to that, is to in some way provide it with some legitimacy.
And yet I find myself unable not to. I mean to not let faggots buttfuck each other is to prevent them spreading AIDS to each other and literally dying. Not that I care, but it's literally the opposite of "causing harm."
And don't ever let these people get away with the "muh causing harm" argument. <a href="../Articles/CalculatingWarPropagandistKillCount.html">Calculating WMD Liars Kill Count,</a> is probably the most important article I have written. The people telling you that Christians refusing to let Shitdicks fuck each other in the ass on their University Campus "causes harm," are Mass Murder Propagandists, who told us that Saddam Hussein had WMD when they wanted to murder 600,000 Iraqi civilians and 5,000 of our troops.

It found the public interest of the law profession gives it the right to promote equality by ensuring equal access, support diversity within the bar and prevent harm to LGBT students.
...
Two dissenting justices, Suzanne Cote and Russell Brown, sided with TWU, arguing that the law societies' powers should be more limited when it comes to approving law programs.

TWU's proposed law school at its Langley, B.C., campus was granted preliminary approval by the B.C. provincial government in 2013, but that approval was later withdrawn due to legal challenges.

In B.C. and Nova Scotia, the courts had sided with TWU, ruling the university has the right to act on its beliefs as long as there is no evidence of harm.

Ontario's Court of Appeal ruled the other way, calling the covenant "deeply discriminatory to the LGBT community."

This is where the Cuckservative does the "well this just goes to show that we need to respect the rulings of the court because muh two cuckservative judges." Yeah LOL. That two judges passed what can only be considered a sane ruling is not an endorsement. This should have been laughed out of the court. So no, the very system that allows this is fundamntally illegitimate.

Janet Epp Buckingham, a TWU professor who helped develop the law school proposal, said she was saddened by the ruling.

"We feel that this is a loss for diversity in Canada," she said. "Canada has traditionally upheld values of diversity for a broad array of religious views. So we're very disappointed in the way the Supreme Court of Canada has ruled today."

Buckingham said the university will take time to process the long and complex judgment before deciding on next steps. One option the university's board of governors could consider is lifting the mandatory covenant, she said.

Other professional programs at the university, such as the teaching and nursing programs, have been operating successfully for years, turning out graduates who are well-respected in the community, Buckingham said. She said she does not anticipate any challenges to those programs, whose students are also required to sign the covenant.

Wow, thanks Janet. Make sure to always agree with the anti-White Pro-Pervert premise. Yes, please. You're doing us all a real favour by going out there and saying "no but Sodomites are the REAL haters of diversity," and then losing the case anyway. Thanks Janet, where would we be without you.

And I strongly suspect that the other programs will go along without incident, because nurses and teachers, especially nurses, are peasants who don't have political power. Lawyers do, because they have been artificially given the privilege of being able to practice law. Therefore it is crucially important to make sure that anyone who could possibly speak on behalf of the people be denied the right to practice law.

Law Society of B.C. President Miriam Kresivo called the ruling "a recognition of the responsibility of the Law Society to uphold the rights of all persons and to protect the public interest.

"The court recognized that the Law Society has an overarching interest in protecting equality and human rights, as well as ... removing inequitable barriers to the legal profession, in carrying out our duties and ensuing public confidence."

Why do all of the women opposed to us have to be so beautiful and elegant? More seriously, when looking for pictures of Miriam here I stumbled upon an article in Canadian Lawyer Mag, which detailed Miriam leading the charge to ban "Licensed Paralegals," from practicing some aspects of law. Just in case you thought that law wasn't a criminal profession. 

Here's a question for the common man. Do you think that your interests were served by the Law Society of BC banning Trinity Western Universities Law Program? Do you think your interests were served by the Law Society of BC banning Licensed Paralegals?

Let this serve to discredit any "muh rule of law," propaganda that you hear.
