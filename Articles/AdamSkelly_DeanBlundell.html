I’m tired of all your conflict but I know a fucking SWEET ‘grift’ when I see one.

Adam Skelly, who was arrested this week after a 4 day battle with the City of Toronto over defying the lockdown restrictions at Adamson BBQ in Etobicoke, is a fraud.  He’s human garbage parading around as a conspiracy theorist and he doesn’t give a fuck about human life – that part of Adam Skelly is legit – but he’s a fraud through and through.
His go fund me legal defence fund now has 300k in it and he’s looking for more!

Yeah, Blundell at no point in this piece ever actually shows that Skelly is in fact "looking for more." In fact, Skelly's GoFundMe Legal Defense was set for 10k. He got 300k because of genuine grassroots support. The kind of thing that Blundell, a well promoted propagandist that I honestly had never heard of, hates and envies with a passion. But what he writes next is so genuinely absurd, that I actually suggest you go and check out the original piece, because you won't believe that I'm not taking him out of context.

I cruised his Twitter feed this weekend and talked to a few media people who were covering the event and all signs point to what we all knew this was to begin with.

Adam Skelly is using a deadly pandemic responsible for the death of thousands of Canadians as a mechanism of personal gain and his Tweets aren’t helping.

Yes, he actually includes five tweets from an account that is clearly not Adam Skelly himself, "The Adam Skelly Story - Etobicoke 2020," and is highly critical of Skelly. I mean, Adam Skelly has a real twitter account.
<img src="../Images/adamSkellyRealTwitter.PNG">
I wasn't kidding when I said this was so bafflingly stupid that it defies belief. Seriously, don't worry about giving Blundell some traffic, check out that piece and understand that he is directly claiming that the tweets are from Adam Skelly.

TADA.  This sick fuck invited, taunted, begged what appears to be a vulnerable segment of society into his restaurant knowing full well a viral pandemic lockdown was in effect so he line his pockets and achieve relevance.  He’s not fighting for small business.  He just said he was because telling you he’s using you by endangering your life to get a leg up, doesn’t have the same effect.

I actually decided to watch some video of Dean Blundell. I tried to watch two videos and I honestly couldn't make it past 2 minutes cumulative. Here's the first video I tried to watch.

I mean I was honestly hoping for something more annoying, or anti-white, or entertaining in the slightest. The guy just has zero charisma, and is painfully boring.

He successfully weaponized the health and safety of hundreds of people under the disguise of being a small business martyr in less than 72 hours managing to con a bunch of mentally ill people into giving him $120,000 along the way.  Incredible, really.

That’s called being a total Fraud.  He’s like the Inbred version of Danny Ocean if Danny ran a shit hole BBQ joint down by the Lake in Toronto, that is.

The guy above is calling the guy below inbred.

The most dangerous thing about this pandemic isn’t the pandemic itself.  It’s snake handlers like Adam Skelly who cares more about a go fund me total over $100k than the life of a 10 year old Manitoba boy who died of this COVID19 ‘hoax’ yesterday.

This morning that beautiful, dead, 10-year-old boy’s parents can’t get up. His family is crippled with grief.
This morning, Adam Skelly is using the death of this 10 year old boy and thousands of other innocent Canadians to promote a pulled pork sandwich and if you believe in science, you shouldn’t be ok with it.
Suck on that when you Tweet me about how great of a fucking guy this little Dick Farmer is.

I honestly can't tell if this is self-parody. It reads like something I would write to make fun of Shitlibs. His family is apparently "crippled with grief," says Dean Blundell about a random family in Manitoba who he has never personally interacted with nor talked to. I mean I'm just imagining Dean Blundell sitting down to write this piece, and fantasizing about an adult couple lying in their beds all day because their son died of Covid. "Oh my god, I bet they literally can't get up," thinks Dean Blundell.

But then he switches it up to "if you believe in science, you shouldn't be okay with using dead children to promote pulled pork sandwiches," which is a statement so interesting it demands its own article all by itself. Apparently, if you do not believe in science, you should in fact support the usage of dead children to promote delicious snacks. However, if you believe in science, as a general principle you should therefore not support using dead children to promote those very same delicious snacks.

And then he resorts to calling Adam Skelly a "little Dick Farmer," an insult so lame that I once again wonder if its intentionally lame. Maybe ironic more than actually self-parody. However, Antifa basically don't have any real insults they can call each other, like Faggot or <a href="../Articles/BarryNeufeldTheRetardWord.html">"The R Word (Retard)"</a>, so they have to resort to these unfunny and spiritually dead fake insults that are so fucking stupid that they give me AIDS. Another is "Jabroni," or something else equally lame. 

We're being insulted by Reddit The Person.

Also, Adam Skelly is a very wealthy young man. He comes from money and now you’re giving him yours.  His Dad gave him the land and seed money to start these mid range BBQ joints.

Steve’s comment about Skelly summarized Adam Skelly and Steve knows Skelly so remember Skelly is a con man every time he puts his face on TV pretending to give a fuck about your rights.

Alright first off Skelly was given the money for the land to start his first restaurant, which he has turned into three very successful restaurants. But more to the point the comment shows how successful Skelly's restaurants were, and the commenter even goes so far as to say "he's definitely hurting his own business."

Yeah gee, it's almost like he's a small business owner who was being driven out of business by completely arbitrary and capricious pseudo-lockdown laws, and who decided to say "fuck it" to the Corporate-State Complex and <a href="../Articles/AdamSkellyFacesNineCharges.html">Incure their wrath for the greater good.</a>

But really, just look at the propagandists face and move on.
