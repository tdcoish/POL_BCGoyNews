Sterritt came to my attention with two previous articles, about "systemic racism," against Abos in the healthcare system. You can read those articles <a href="../Articles/SterrittAbosWhining.html">here</a>, and <a href="../Articles/StPaulsAboPetition.html">here</a>. I briefly went down the rabbit hole on Angela Sterritt herself, and what I found is quite typical. I'm not going to do deep analysis of this, mostly just pick out the important details.
Here is what I found on her website. 
<a href="https://angelasterritt.com/">Angela Sterrit</a>
TDC_ARTICLE_START
Angela Sterritt is an award-winning journalist, author, artist and keynote speaker from British Columbia. Sterritt has worked as a journalist for close to twenty years and has been with the CBC since 2003.

So we see links to the CBC, something which comes up quite often. I'm just going to skip through pieces of her bio from here on out.
TDC_ARTICLE_START
In 2020, Sterritt was nominated by the Canadian Screen Awards for best reporter of the year in Canada. In the same year she became an adjunct journalism professor at the University of British Columbia through the Asper Visiting Fellowship.  In early 2020 Sterritt’s book Unbroken, a work that is part memoir and part investigating the murders and disappearances of Indigenous women was bought by Greystone Books.
TDC_ARTICLE_STOP
Asper Visiting Fellowship is apparently a thing that can make you an adjunct journalism professor at UBC.

Reading more about it, it's where they take existing propagandists, and then bring them into the school as a sort of "get experience from propagandists shilling in the wild," type thing.
TDC_ARTICLE_START
From 2018- 2019, Sterritt was a keynote speaker, emcee, and moderator at dozens of events, including giving a Ted Talk, a Massey Lecture hosting Tanya Talaga’s talk and a number of other prestigious events. In 2019, Sterritt’s documentary on the complexity of Indigenous support for and challenges against the TransMountain Pipeline expansion project won an RTDNA award for best long feature.

I decided to have a quick watch at that TED Talk. It's as shitty as it is Anti-White. The entire talk is about Abo Nationalism and how Whitey needs to get off muh land. She's also clearly nervous, and wearing too much makeup. And finally, it's gotten just 2,000 views, despite being almost a year old.
TDC_ARTICLE_START
Her reports have appeared in the Globe and Mail, The National, CBC’s The Current, and various other national and local news programs. She currently works with CBC Vancouver as a television, radio and online reporter. She is a proud member of the Gitxsan Nation.

In 2018, Sterritt was chosen among three other Canadian authors to adjudicate the esteemed $25,000 Shaughnessy Cohen Political Book Prize. In that year she was also selected to be a juror for numerous journalism and arts awards across Canada.

Sterritt is currently completing a book about missing and murdered Indigenous women that weaves in her own story of surviving violence as an Indigenous girl.
TDC_ARTICLE_STOP
If she tries to pretend that the men who did violence to her were White I'm going to have to...
<img src="../Images/xToDoubt2.png">
I'll bet she'll vaguely insinuate that the Abos who beat the shit out of her are something something system of White Supreeeeemacy, goy.

Next up we have the awards. You can let your eyes skip over this shit, because you've seen this before.
TDC_ARTICLE_START
In 2018, Sterritt won multiple awards for her CBC column, Reconcile This which explores the tensions between Indigenous people and institutions in British Columbia. Among many awards, it won an international Gabriel award and led to policy changes including significant changes at the Ministry of Children and Family Development and its treatment of  Indigenous parents and children.

In 2017, Sterritt accepted the Investigative Award of the year from Journalists for Freedom of Expression for her team at CBC and their coverage of missing and murdered Indigenous women. She won Best Audio Work of the Year in 2016 at the prominent ImagineNative film festival in Toronto for her CBC documentary called ‘The Story She Carries’. In the same year, Sterritt was nominated for a Canadian Online Publishing Award for her writing on MMIW.

Sterritt’s a text feature on missing and murdered Indigenous, women, girls and two-spirit people earned her a nomination for a Canadian Association of Journalists Award.  The topic is the focus of a book she is now writing that digs into the cases of those missing or murdered along the Highway of Tears, at the Pickton farm and in Manitoba.

In 2015 Sterritt was awarded a prestigious William Southam Journalism Fellowship at Massey College in Toronto and is the first known Indigenous person in Canada ever to receive the award in the school’s 60-year history.

Sterritt and her production team at CBC’s 8th Fire (WATCH here) earned a nomination for a Canadian Screen Award for their digital platform with the groundbreaking TV series on Indigenous history and current realities.

Her other awards include winning Best Radio of the year (2013) at the ImagineNative Film Festival, for her documentary on Cindy Blackstock and two CBC President’s awards for her work as a producer on CBC’s 8th Fire and a reporter at  CBC Aboriginal.

Imagine being so oppressed that you're winning $25,000.00 journalism prizes and being recognized by the Canadian Association of Journalism, the Canadian Online Publishing Award, the Journalists for Freedom of Expression. I mean I could go on. 

Actually that last one is particularly hilarious. Hey goy, do you think any Lampshadocaust Fact-Checker has ever won any "Journalists for Freedom of Expression" award? You think anybody who said "you know I made a list of all the WMD Liars, and it's 80% Jews," has won that award?

Sterritt is also a visual artist with her paintings exhibited across the world. In August of 2016, she painted a large mural in Jiangxi China with eight other international artists. In 2012 took on the dream of her life — animating and exhibiting five of her original paintings on over 300 LCD screens on the Toronto Transit system, 33 English Malls, and the Calgary Airport. The theme was the 1200+ missing and murdered Indigenous women in Canada.

I have to say, while unimpressive, it's a lot less unimpressive than I would have thought. And again, I bet she's subtly implying that it's Whitey's fault that a whole bunch of Abo women get murdered and never have their bodies found.

For the record, that is legitimately a tragedy. Not the reason why I got into politics, but a tragedy nevertheless. However, rest assured no actual action will ever be undertaken by these Anti-Whites in terms of solving this problem.
TDC_ARTICLE_START
As a motivational speaker, Sterritt talks about her climb from being a vulnerable Indigenous youth living in poverty to becoming one of Canada’s top journalists. She also talks about breaking stereotypes and creating change and relationships in Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities. In her service work, Sterritt speaks to journalists and students in newsrooms and in university classrooms about reporting in Indigenous communities.
TDC_ARTICLE_STOP
Yeah so she's basically an Anti-White grifter. There you go, that's the TL:DR. 
<img src="../Images/sterrittDecolonizeMedia.jpg">
Also, she's 3/4's White. Irish and Abo on her fathers side, full Irish on her mothers side. 

UPDATE:
But wait, I found a video of her on YouTube, as part of the "We Matter Campaign." <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DGykJRFtI8&ab_channel=WeMatterCampaign">Video here.</a>
<img src="../Images/sterrittWeMatterCampaign.PNG">
First of all, notice how the likes/dislikes and comments have been disabled, goy?
<img src="../Images/bezosLaughing.jpg">
But mostly, at just 40 seconds in, she starts to talk about the bullying she ostensibly experienced during school. She says, and I shit you not.
TDC_ARTICLE_START
It would get so bad that I would change schools, and then it would start all over again. I remember kids coming around the corner with 2 by 4's, to hit me. I remember getting punched in the face. I remember getting pushed into the ground. I remember groups of girls surrounding me, and sometimes I would have to run, sometimes I would have to fight. I was in grade 6.
TDC_ARTICLE_STOP
<img src="../Images/xToDoubt.jpg">
And no, these weren't Abo schools she's talking about. She's pretending that at a school full of White Children, aged 12, she was having them waiting around the corner for her with 2x4's. 2x4's. FUCKING 12 year olds with 2x4's, who had it out for this girl so badly that they would be chillin on the corner like some cartoon street gang, just so they could all get arrested and sent to juvenile prison. To go along with the packs of 10 year old girls knuckles out ready to scrap. Sound like a fucking video game level, but it was this girls real life.

No really, it sounds like the tutorial level of some video game. Where the designers want to give you some easy enemies to mow down in some brawler, so "hey, fuck it, why not 10 year old schoolgirls?" But then they have to mix it up a little, so you've also got 12 year old boys with 2x4's. 

And no, she doesn't actually give you the names of who did this to her. If she did that, then they could sue her for defamation. Instead, she just lies and talks about some imaginary schoolchildren because she's a narcissistic attention seeker who has it out for White People, because her fake identity as a 1/4 Gitxsan person is so damn important to her.
