B.C.'s provincial health officer is seeking an injunction prohibiting gatherings by three Christian churches that are challenging her orders suspending in-person religious services.

Lawyers for Dr. Bonnie Henry and B.C.'s attorney general will be in B.C. Supreme Court on Friday seeking orders against the leaders of Langley's Riverside Calvary Chapel, Abbotsford's Immanuel Covenant Reformed Church and the Free Reformed Church of Chilliwack.

The province filed an application for the injunction last week along with a response to a petition by the churches and a handful of others who want to overturn Henry's orders.

According to the court documents, the province is seeking an order that would prevent elders and members from gathering to worship in their churches and from organizing celebrations, ceremonies, baptisms, funerals or any other "event" as defined by Henry's orders.

The order would also authorize police to detain anyone they have grounds to believe is planning to attend a religious service organized by any of the three churches.

Alrighty. First of all, Dr. Bonnie Henry is a complete and utter tool of the NDP, and this is absurdly arbitrary. You'll see just how arbitrary this is when you see what is not being shut down.

The application for the injunction comes just days after Henry announced an indefinite extension to the orders she issued last November suspending all events and social gatherings in an effort to reduce COVID-19 transmission.

In a petition filed in early January, pastors with the three Fraser Valley Christian churches claim that Henry is violating rights to expression and religious worship guaranteed by the Constitution by shutting churches while allowing restaurants and businesses to remain open.

Their petition seeks to overturn the order against in-person worship.

Hey goys, did you know that Restaurants, where people are eating food packed together tightly without wearing masks, is a worse transmitter of Covid than Churches, where people can sit as far away from each other as they would like, and aren't eating? Did you know that, goy?

The province filed a response to the petition last week, claiming there is "no question that restrictions on gatherings to avoid transmission of (COVID-19) limit rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Charter of Rights and Freedoms."

But the province says the limits are justified.

"Rights and freedoms under the charter are not absolute," the response says.

"Protection of the vulnerable from death or severe illness and protection of the health-care system from being swamped by an out-of-control pandemic is also clearly of constitutional importance."

I am not a lawyer, so I don't know if their strategy is solid. However, I suspect that they're making the typical gay Cuckservative "Muh Religious Freedom" bullshit that gets laughed at by Globo Homo Schlomo every single time. The only possible argument to make is "this is an arbitrary ruling designed to attack religious people that has no justification in reality." But yes, this is beyond ridiculous.

An affidavit from acting deputy provincial health officer Dr. Brian Emerson states that the science shows that COVID-19 spreads better in indoor settings where people from different households gather for longer than 15 minutes.

Apparently SCIENCE has proven that COVID doesn't transfer if you're a member of BLM or Antifa doing an anti-White riot, or in a restaurant getting drunk and sloppily eating. Yep, immune from COVID.

If that doesn't work, maybe just hold your meeting at a school. Schools are magically safe from transfering COVID, even though children have terrible hygeine and are known vectors of disease spreading.

Churches also have the ability to ask for reconsideration under Section 43 of the Public Health Act.

The response says one such application led to an exemption for synagogues to hold services in open tents with no more than 25 people present.

Anyway, the group is being represented by the Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedoms, a Calgary group. There is also the Association for Reformed Political Action, a self-described "grassroots Christian Political Advocacy Organization." They seem a little bit more legitimately grassroots, and therefore more likely to get actual results.
