I apologize for the delay in articles, goy. It's not that nothing has been happening, it's that my 2021 got off to a bang, literally. Okay, not so much literally, but the fan on my Graphics Card in my PC suddenly committed seppuku, and I have been waiting patiently for a replacement. 

Seriously, the card made this horrible sound. It was the kind of death gurgle that I've never heard from a computer component. Not even a fan whine, I could outright hear things crunching around in there.

Anyway, I decided to deal with this by first taking it out and applying some silicon lube to the thing. That kind of worked, but then I think the lube got flung off or something, because the problem came back. Finally I decided to just put on headphones to deal with the problem, and my computer eventually said.
TDC_ARTICLE_START
Well fuck you too!
TDC_ARTICLE_STOP
And just went and seppuku'd itself.

Unfortunately not by literally exploding, just by shutting down, but just between you and me, in the future we'll pretend that I heard a bang, and then the computer sizzled and smoke came out everywhere. In fact, this started a fire, and a little puppy was caught in the crossfire, and I had to run out of the burning building carrying this little puppy in my arms.

Anyway, the problem has been rectified, so stay tuned, because we've got quite the backlog here.
