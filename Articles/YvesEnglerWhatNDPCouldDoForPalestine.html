TDC_ARTICLE_START
NDP leader Jagmeet Singhâ€™s call for an arms embargo on Israel is a positive development. But, with tens of thousands taking to the streets across the country on Saturday we should expect more forthright efforts to stop Israeli violence, which has killed well over 220 Palestinians, including 64 children, in the past ten days.

Below are 10 demands the NDP and progressive activists could promote to end Canadian complicity with Israeli violence and Palestinian dispossession:

I almost feel bad writing this, making fun of Yves Engler. Jagmeet Singh and the NDP isn't going to do fuck all, except continue to work with the jew nationalist pro-racial cleansing CIJA, and other similar groups, while saying barely enough to attempt to suck up money and support away from someone like me.

I was going to quote it, but it's actually not that great of a list. Removing the Palestinian Liberation Front from the terrorist list is great, but you have to pair that with also removing the Proud Boys from there. Do you see how you really can't have one without the other? 

Actually that last point really needs to be touched on. Kosher-Leftist arguments against jew nationalism are really bad. It's basically "muh colonialism, muh poor brown people." My arguments against the jew nationalists at CIJA, B'Nai Brith, etcetera, is really good. My argument is "hey look at this anti-White hate group that gets nationalist groups in White Countries put on terrorist lists but is also a jew nationalist org that supports violent racial cleansing against a minority group, look how malicious they are."

It is always better to show an opponent as malicious, rather then engage with them on abstract terms. For example, when David Frum gave his talk in 2019 "Life in the Disinformation Age," where he said that Facebook wasn't doing enough to censor "disinformation," the argument he wants to have is "abstract concept of free speech, versus disinfo causes harm." The conversation I would have would be:

"How many children were murdered in that war in Iraq that you lied us into?"

Showing your opponent is malicious is the speedrun of politics, and someone, no matter how genuine, stuck on kosher-left or kosher-right politics can never do this. The useful value they provide us is in discrediting the political parties and institutions that represent the part of politics that the little people are supposed to get.
