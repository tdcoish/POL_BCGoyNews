I mean, it's hard to have commentary here, but just in case you don't understand what's going on. "Jessica" Yaniv, who's real name is Jonathan Simpson BTW, was calling the Langley, BC Fire Department over and over again, pretending to be stuck and needing their masculine assistance. According to them, this pervert did this over 30 times, and they finally got sick of this, so they will now be pressing legal action against this weirdo if it does it again. Apparently it took them literally 30 times before they even threatened legal repercussions, but at least they eventually got there. 

Jessica "Wax my ballsack bigot" Yaniv is quite the character, and I'll have a lot more to write about him in the upcoming days.
