                    NOTE: This story is 3 months old, but I reprinted it here, because I think the point that our government has absolutely no competence to handle a pandemic remains true and important.
The CBC article found <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/covid-19-bc-phase-three-john-horgan-1.5625598">here</a> is long and not worth reading. Iâ€™m just going to sum it up.
Horgan recently moved us into "phase 3 of the Coronavirus Plan", wherein a few businesses such as hotels re-open, and schools and universities are allowed to re-open, although they may not be currently operating, what with it being summer and all. My response to the Coronavirus disaster doesn't belong in a forum post, so please do read this policy page I wrote outlining our parties preparation for and response to serious disruptions from wars, pandemics, natural disasters, or any others.
But I think I may have failed to properly explain just how utterly incapable the ruling class is at dealing with this pandemic, or any pandemic. Do you see how every single step of the NDP's idiotic "Coronavirus Plan" is an imposition on you? I'm not saying this in some lolbertarian "muh freedom" idiocy, I mean, they aren't actually doing anything. They aren't providing any service to you. The only way that they can be seen to be doing anything at all in the face of a pandemic is by arbitrarily cracking down on you, because they have no competence to do anything else.
Providing food from pre-built warehouses? Nope. Providing quarantine buildings for the suspected ill? Nope. Providing people with the masks that they require us to wear? Nope. Doing consistent and aggressive and accurate testing of the populace for Coronavirus? Nope. Not happening. They're far too busy stealing our money and trying to turn orphaned three year olds into trannies.
I underestimated the day to day incompetence of the regime. They have all this infrastructure and competence to go after you and put you in jail if you call someone a faggot online, because that's what they want to do. They have no infrastructure to provide for you in a disaster, because that's not what they want to do. After we seize power from these people we are going to need to rebuild a huge section of the bureaucratic and physical infrastructure of this province.
