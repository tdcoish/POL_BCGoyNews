Ginny Roth: Derek Sloan and pro-life groups are sabotaging the social conservative cause in Canada
TDC_ARTICLE_STOP
Thank you Roth, I was unsure what to think.

There are not many mainstream conservatives comfortable describing themselves as social conservatives these days and it’s not hard to understand why. Despite many Canadians passionately describing their personal political convictions as centering around the role of the family and the community, social conservatives in Canada are understood to be single-issue outsiders, intent on disrupting, rather than building — opposing rather than governing. Unfortunately, the lead up to the Conservative party’s upcoming convention demonstrates exactly why a vocal few party members are giving social conservatives a bad name.

Okay Roth.

This distraction could not come at a worse time. As the global pandemic eats away at the fabric of Canadian society, social conservative policy solutions have never been more relevant or politically appealing. And yet, instead of presenting Canadians with thoughtful proposals, prominent social conservatives are fixated on playing the victim and settling political scores.

(((Roth))) is being super vague here, and is also a bitch. However, if it means Libertarianism, then sure. I'm personally frustrated with LOLbertarianism, especially when dealing with this pandemic. Meeeaaaassskss are gay and unhygenic, and the very same propagandists telling you to not wear them are also telling you that BLM riots and Antifa riots have never spread a single case of COVID. 

Having said that, the real solution to a foreign disease, is to close the borders, build quarantine hospitals/buildings, and have a government driven system that can actually withstand being shut down for a short period of time. The latter part would involve a, god forbid, SOCIALIST system of providing food and power for the people similar to our, god forbid, SOCIALIST healthcare. "Social Conservatives," aren't going to propose that, and that's why they aren't popular.

With the Conservative party convention approaching in March, members are meeting virtually across the country to elect delegates from every riding to vote on policy and elect a National Council (the party’s governing body which represents the interests of its members). You might expect that in the year of zoom meeting burnout, interest in attending virtually would be quite low. Instead, these local meetings have been heavily contested, as elements of the party organize to elect their own slates of delegates with the sole intention of undermining recently elected leader, Erin O’Toole.

Who in their right mind would want to undermine this pinnacle of masculinity? This career politician covered in a coat of slime, possibly his donors jizz? Bad people, that's who.

The organizing appears to be driven by Derek Sloan , the failed leadership candidate who was recently kicked out of caucus, and the single-issue Campaign Life Coalition, an organization which seems to count its wins in number of political careers destroyed, rather than abortions averted. These rabble rousers are seeking to install their representatives into positions of power in the party, fixated on internal party policy, with no plan for Canada or perspective on how to win the next election.

I'm going to have to take a much closer look at this Campaign Life Coalition, because they appear to be doing everything correctly. To put it simply, any actual real organization absolutely does not unconditionally support x party because "they're better than the other guys." This is the cuck strategy. This is laughable. Instead of that, successful peasant groups do:
1) Genocide "own side" faggots who deviate even the slightest from your goals.
2) Refuse to compromise even the slightest.
3) HODL the line.

Sloan and the CLC are already boasting about their success in the media, using the cause of social conservatism to justify their unhelpful campaign. These distractions should be particularly disappointing to those of us whose policy agenda the disruptors claim to champion, especially since our cause is so salient today.

As we emerge from a once in a generation crisis, our biggest challenges are ripe for socially conservative solutions.

You are literally saying that Social Conservatives are getting in the way of... Social Conservatism? Did no one edit this propaganda? Is Ginny Roth sucking the editors dick or something, and he just doesn't want to critique what she writes? 

Because this is borderline retarded. If you went to the very same people who you admitted are literally single issue anti-Abortion voters and you said "hey, we're happy to do the anti-abortion stuff, but we also are pro-family and have some economic policies to help with that," you would get 100% of them supporting you. THEY ARE FUCKING SINGLE ISSUE VOTERS YOU DISINGENOUS FUCK. But even beyond that, 90% of them would support those policies anyway, so this is double fake.

According to the Brookings Institute, already dropping fertility rates in the United States are being exacerbated by a COVID-19-related baby bust, with families delaying or opting not to have children at all due to precarious financial situations. We can assume the same is true for struggling Canadian families. Under government-mandated isolation, we are growing more atomized, separated from our families, our friends and our community institutions. Places of worship, already suffering from public indifference, have been left empty and the less fortunate among us, those who most need our help, are struggling as jobs are lost, mental health supports fall short and opioid addiction reaches an all-time high.

Canada’s social conservatives have a unique opportunity to present solutions to increase birth rates and strengthen and support families and community institutions. Instead, a few malcontents are fighting intra-party battles under the social conservative banner, trying to embarrass our leadership and losing touch with the dire needs of struggling Canadians.

Yes because you are literally telling single issue voters that you don't support their issue, DESPITE THEIR ISSUE BEING POPULAR ACCORDING TO POLLING. You are going to anti-Abortion activists and saying "fuck you, we love abortions," and then blaming them for not supporting you. 

The fucking arrogance of the Conservative Party is unreal. These people view us as goy-cattle, good for nothing but votes, and have the exact reaction to being denied our votes as a king would to being denied "his" tax money. Despite them spitting in our face to begin with.
<img src="../Images/canadaAbortionPoll.jpg">
And no, I just can't let this go. Abortion isn't popular, it's disgusting, and that is the majority view of Canadians. The Conservative Party is mad that a group of anti-abortion activists are saying "fuck you," because the Shills running the party said "our donors like abortion, vote for us anyway," and they were horrified to find out that LITERAL SINGLE ISSUE VOTERS WHO HAVE A POPULAR ISSUE decided to fuck with them back. They are absolutely steamed at this. Livid.

As Canada’s conservatives are distracted by infighting, American conservatives are engaged in a passionate debate about how best to support families and increase birth rates. Mitt Romney, Senator for Utah and former Presidential nominee, has put forward an ambitious proposal to streamline bureaucratic welfare programs and replace them with direct financial support for families with incentives built-in to encourage parents to both have more children and find and keep meaningful work. Some proponents of his plan even point to a reduction in abortion rates when similar programs have been implemented elsewhere.

So you agree with the premise that abortion is bad, but you don't agree with the premise that it should be banned? Instead you've got some economic bullshitism proposed by a billionaire. Very impressed.

This year’s election will be a pandemic election. O’Toole has rightly pointed out that Canadians are particularly concerned with how the economy will recover from this crisis. We know what the Liberals and the NDP will propose because for them, there is never a problem so big or complex that a new government program won’t solve it. And we shouldn’t fool ourselves that this approach won’t be appealing to Canadians who are struggling and desperate for support.

Social conservatives can step up and lead the movement, supporting its leadership by presenting thoughtful solutions to a once in a generation challenge — solutions that will increase birth rates, strengthen families and support community institutions, just when they need it most. Instead, we’re fighting each other, trying to embarrass our leadership and losing touch with the dire needs of struggling Canadians.

This feels like the "optics" debate all over again. Where White Nationalists were supposed to support the explicitly anti-White Nationalist (but pro Jew-Nationalist, goy) GOP, and their lack of support was the real problem. The GOP being an anti-White institution unwilling to do anything for White People, no that's not the problem. The real problem was those "WigNats," who didn't support Charlie Kirk's GOP. 

Here we see those filthy anti-Abortion Activists, who don't just meekly accept being fucked over by the Righteous and Wonderful Conservative Party of Canada. These disgusting peasants seem to think that them getting what they want is what really matters. This is ridiculous. They should know that they just exist to help the Pro-Abortion Conservative Party of Canada get elected. They just exist to help Erin O'Toole's career.

Right?
