When Eva Clarke, a relatively young-looking woman showed up to have her picture taken with Holocaust survivors in Great Britain for an upcoming photo-book, the incredulous photographer, Matt Writtle, felt compelled to ask her how it was possible that such a young person survived the Holocaust — and the answer he got was equally unbelievable:

My ovaries on fire awaiting the news of the anointed one. What sayeth this jew who hath surviveth the pillars of Auschwitz, or in this case Malthausen?

“I sat and listened to her story. Her mother weighed just six stone [84 lbs] and was on the back of a cart going up to the gas chamber, when the Allies starting bombing. She then went into labor and had to give birth on the back of this cart, in silence, on her own, while other prisoners attempted to cover her. If she had been found out, the guards would have shot her and the baby.

“There are so many horrendous stories, but that one for me really stood out,” Writtle says.

So this Jewess is claiming that her mother gave birth to her on her way to the gas chambers, at a concentration camp that officials have admitted is not an execution camp, secret or otherwise. 

Totally legit. 

Anyone who questions this has a mental illness.
