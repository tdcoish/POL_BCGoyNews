Unfortunately for you, because the author of this website is a retard, you don't get a properly embedded tweet. Yes, I know, I'm terrible. Let me take a screenshot of this for you, just so you can see what you're missing.

UPDATE: Slightly less retarded than previously believed.

I'd highly recommend you take a look at that tweet, because the video linked, created by the German Government, is a video comparing surviving Covid to surviving WW2. THe video itself is clearly comedy, and I think it's actually genuinely funny, both intentionally and unintentionally. Partly because they clearly can see how ridiculous it is, yet also they can't see how ridiculous this is. It's hard to explain.

It's like this Michael Bay self-parody.

Where the whole thing is that it's like this guy exists in a world where the only things that happen is things blow up. And the only joke in this world is "LOL, too many things are blowing up." But the punchline to that joke is "BUT IT'S AWESOME THAT WAY LOLOLOL." 

It's this weird zone where someone is just barely intelligent enough to see how ridiculous they are, yet not intelligent enough to stop being so ridiculous. 

Another example might be some muscle headed guy, who makes fun of the fact that he's roided out of his mind. But, being huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuge is the number one most important thing in the world for him. Or some girl with a body made in a lab, who laughs at how big her tits are. But she got her tits that size in the first place.

I'm sort of seeing Covid Catastrophism as this same sort of absurdity. It's like these people understand that they're a joke, but they don't quuuiiiiiiiitttttee understand that they're jokes. It's like they'll say "haha wearing a mask won't do shit," if you really press them on this, but then they'll still demand that you wear a mask. It's a strange sort of midwitism.

Of course, this has been used to destroy small businesses everywhere, so it's not like Joffrey isn't malicious, but it's just interesting getting a window into the psychology of an entire group of people for whom reality is not a compelling motivator.
