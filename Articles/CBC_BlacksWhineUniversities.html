For the record, the entire article below, whatever I bother to print of it, can be summed up completely in just a few lines: "blacks whine about non-existant oppression." To even respond to the claim that blacks whining serves as de facto evidence of them being oppressed, would be to in some way legitimize that absurd claim. 

The idea that if x group whines a lot, they are therefore oppressed, then jews, ie. the people who refer to others as subhuman goy-cattle, would be the most oppressed group on the planet. In reality, a group complaining and then having these complaints be pushed by the multi-billion dollar corporate-state complex propaganda is, by definition, not really oppressed.

Anyway, on to the propaganda.

A law student at the University of Windsor says he's come face-to-face with what it means to be Black on campus in Canada, and the reality of what that means scares him.

"I started seeing in real time what anti-Black racism can do," Jordan Afolabi told The Fifth Estate. "It can be the difference between me being a lawyer and me being a criminal."

I'm not going to bother responding to the actual claims. Instead I'll just put up pictures of the dygenic propagandists so you can have a little chuckle at them.

Students, staff and faculty at some of Canada's largest universities say they have experienced anti-Black racism on campus, and that they were targeted if they spoke out about their treatment, an investigation by The Fifth Estate has found.

Ah, what a beauty she is indeed! Truly, the propagandists who work for billionaires are the most elegant, graceful, and beautiful in the land.

As an aside, do you notice they've been trying the "anti-Black racism," line now? Thank god we have a Free and Fair Press that Defends Democracy from Misinformers Online.

In February 2019, Afolabi was running late for class and ended up in an altercation with a white student on campus. When he opened a door, it struck another student who was trying to enter at the same time. 

"The student approached me aggressively asking why I hit him with the door," Afolabi said, and a fight began. "At that point, I defended myself … I just kept trying to tell him, like, walk away, stop."

This event set off a chain reaction for Afolabi that spanned more than a year and affected his education, he said.

Both students filed internal reports with the Office of Academic Integrity, but only Afolabi was banned from campus, with the exception of attending classes. 

"I mean, it's a racial double standard, very clearly … it's just absurd to me," Afolabi said.

Okay, I said I wasn't going to comment, but holy shit this is amazing. So everyone knows what really happened here. Jequeerus here assaulted a student, almost certainly a White student. He then tried taunting said student. Then he got suspended from university for an entire year because assaulting a student is bad. That he got suspended from campus, but still allowed to attend classes, for assaulting a White Student is "absurd to him."

He also claims that the University of Windsor is racially discriminating against him because they didn't suspend the student he violently assaulted.

Believing he was unfairly targeted by the university, he launched an internal human rights complaint. 

The University of Windsor said it can't comment because of confidentiality and an ongoing investigation.

In July 2019 — several months after the altercation, and after the ban was lifted — Afolabi went to the university's administrative building to follow up on his complaint. 

He saw the president's administrative secretary in the hallway and said she seemed agitated upon seeing him.

This propaganda is almost unbelievable. If it were just slightly less ridiculous, it would be enraging. So Demarcus here is getting into an altercation with a White Woman. Let me reiterate, this is a black who was suspended from campus for a violent assault, and now he's here to intimidate a woman. #classy.

"I tried to speak but she just wasn't giving me a moment to speak," he said. "I said, 'Look, I'm going to need you to calm down' … she kept cutting me off. She felt rather upset that I would tell her to calm down and she turned and walked away."

She told Afolabi to wait in the front lobby of the administrative building. Within minutes, she had called campus police from the president's office. 

"We have a Black male who won't give his name or state his business and he's kind of loitering," she said on the call.

So he... refused to give this administrative assistant his name, agitated her, taunted her "calm down wahmen," and then got the cops called on him. Truly a victim if ever there was one. Anyway the police showed up but then didn't arrest him, which is sort of disappointing. 

I cheated earlier, but for now I'm just going to show pictures of the last propagandist as well as the BLM Chimps.

"The blatant fact, the truth, is that racialized, Indigenous, Black students on these campuses that we pay to attend are not safe," Azinwi told The Fifth Estate. 

"People need to see it to believe that Black trauma is a thing, that anti-Black racism is a thing. And that's the only way we can prove the really messed up things that are happening to us as a community."

Last September, she led a countrywide strike demanding change at all levels within post-secondary institutions.

"We need to go to the very foundation and start from there," Azinwi said. "You can't keep on repainting the walls and sealing it if the foundation is rotten. You need to rebuild, change the structure, change the policies [and] introduce new policies."

Carol Sutherland, a former employee at Ryerson University in Toronto, and Aimé Avolonto, a French studies professor at York University in Toronto, have launched complaints with the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal.

Both said they had been vocal about what they saw as systemic racism on campus but they felt like they were targeted after speaking out. And they said allegations against them started to pile on.

Okay, I said I wasn't going to respond again, but I just had to. "Allegations against them started to pile on," oh gee, I WONDER why that might have been. So annoying for this propagandist to not actually include the complaints the White students made against them. Probably because they were 100% legit.

Malinda Smith, the first vice-provost of equity, diversity and inclusion at the University of Calgary, is co-author of the book, The Equity Myth, Racialization and Indigeneity at Canadian Universities.

Smith said universities have made progress with other issues such as gender equity but there's still a large knowledge gap when it comes to addressing racial discrimination.

"There's a gap between ... the principle and the practice, the rhetoric and the action … the students, the staff and faculty [are] saying enough is enough. We want action, we want change."

She said academic leaders need more "racial literacy," especially around complaints of systemic racism, which is often less blatant.

If there is denial about racism each and every time and if there are no policies and practices to say here's what racism is ... [and] here are the consequences, most universities don't have that kind of a mechanism," she said.

"We have it for other forms of discrimination, but not racism."
Smith said from what she's seen, some provinces are actually undermining anti-racism efforts and they're defunding anti-racism portfolios, if they have them at all.

"We need to see federal, provincial, municipal governments, all of them, along with institutions ... modelling the change that they want to see in the world," Smith said.

This is the creature that will be "addressing racial discrimination." Something tells me that what it will be doing is racial discrimination against Whites. Never forget that it's ultimately Schlomo that puts these creatures into these positions.
