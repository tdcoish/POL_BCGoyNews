A few days ago I got another email from Maxime Bernier. I think it's worth printing out again for you goyim to see.

Timothy,

I spent the past few days in Alberta. I was at a conference to discuss the future of the province.

Weird. I wasn't following his twitter at all, since I <a href="../Articles/CensoredFromTwatter.html">got banned</a>, but I had no idea that he was in Alberta. Frankly, I had no idea he actually did anything at all, since even during the 2019 Election the guy did very little actual stuff.

Many people there are wondering: If Canada cannot be reformed, should we separate?

We can all agree on one thing: Canada is becoming more dysfunctional every year.

Most of what’s wrong in this country today originates from Ottawa.

We have a government that keeps growing and intruding on provincial jurisdictions, despite what the Constitution says.

A government that keeps infringing upon our fundamental rights and freedoms.

We don’t have a federal government with limited powers anymore. We have an imperial government.

I don't think I can take this guy anymore. At this point, the only possible thing we can think of using Bernier for is a launch pad for our own stuff. This guy is just flat out not a populist. He's this LOLcow, and while I don't think he had bad intentions when he started his party, I just don't see this going anywhere. I also don't see him really thinking that it's going anywhere.

If you think that the real problem with this country is "muh federalism," and not "LOOK AT THESE FUCKING FAGGOTS COMMITTING ATROCITIES AGAINST CHILDREN," or any other real issue, I really don't know what to say.

I believe Canada is still a great country worth saving despite all its flaws.

I told the conference participants about the PPC plan: radical decentralization.

We are a huge country with very diverse regional cultures. Instead of having one-size-fits-all policies imposed by Ottawa, we should have autonomous provincial governments that answer the needs and wishes of their citizens.

Ottawa should only take care of national and international issues on which we have common interests. The rest should be left to the provinces.

You can read my speech here, or watch it here on YouTube (starts at 17 min.).

Timothy, the PPC is the only party proposing to save our country, and save our freedoms, by getting power closer to the people.

You don't need to do anything. I'll try to get in there with these people and see if I can pull them over to us.
