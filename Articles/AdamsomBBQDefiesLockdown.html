I'm a few days late here goyim, but better late than never, and I've got to get up updated on this important story. This story starts 5 days ago, November 24th, 2020.

The owner of Toronto's popular Adamson Barbecue restaurant is kicking up COVID-related controversy once again this week in what might be his boldest (and riskiest) move to date: Opening up for indoor dining while the region is under lockdown.

"Hello Adamson Barbecue fans!" said outspoken restaurateur Adam Skelly in a video posted to his brand's Instagram account Monday evening.

"I'm coming on here today to let you guys know that our Etobicoke location, tomorrow — that's Tuesday — will be opening for in-restaurant dining against provincial orders at eleven o'clock."

This is, of course, forbidden by both the City of Toronto and the provincial government, which moved Toronto and Peel into the "grey zone" lockdown level of its new COVID-19 restriction framework system on Monday.

Holy shit, the GREY ZONE! Man I was on Adam Skelly's side here, but the Grey Zone, oh my god. Oh Jesus Christ. If we've moved into the grey zone all bets are off. Bodies must be getting stacked left and right in downtown Toronto and this man is literally risking a nuclear holocaust in order to reopen his BBQ. What a fucking madman!

Any restaurant found to be in contravention of public health orders currently faces fines of up to $25,000 per day from the municipal government alone. Individuals, such as Skelly, would be personally liable for another $5,000 per day on top of that under City rules.

Bolstered by the support of his fans, Skelly doesn't seem to care.

"For those of you who have eyes to see why I'm doing this, thank you guys so much. Thank you for the messages of support, thank you for filling out my little polls, thank you for letting me know that we have people in our corner," he said in his Instagram dispatch Monday night.

"This is a risky move and you guys gave me the gas to do this, so I just want to thank you guys so much."

Hey, you know who else was given a lot of gas?

That's right, Adolf Hitler. And then he used that gas to build gas chambers cleverly disguised as shower rooms. Then he lured 500,000 Jew Children into those shower room gas chambers with chocolates and other sweets.
And this Adam Skelly has been given gas. And I'm supposed to support this? ABSOLUTELY NOT!

Judging by the number of views on his video — more than 100,000 in less than 24 hours — and the hundreds of comments, Skelly does indeed have many supporters — as well as detractors.

Yeah that's right Jen, you tell him. He's a fucking RUDE piece of shit. You hear that Adam Skelly you fucking rude faggot? Are you listening to me you churlish devil? If there's one thing Canadians won't stand for it's some RUDE queer always acting like a COCKSUCKER in public.

The controversial businessman, who opened the first of his wildly-popular Texas-style BBQ joints in Leaside four years ago, explained in his video why he was taking such a bold stance.

"Top to bottom, this thing stinks — it reeks of corruption," said Skelly of the lockdown, noting that he didn't have enough time to lay out everything in detail.

"I'm going to start with just one point: We're using PCR tests with a cycle threshold of over 40 to drive hysteria around case counts," he continued.

"If you guys understand what's going on with these PCR tests and their cycle thresholds, you know that they're picking up all sorts of other stuff that's not COVID — bacterial infections, other coronaviruses including the common cold, fragments from the flu shot... If you know that, then you know we're going to be about 2.5 per cent positivity rate until the end of spring."

"How many businesses — how many people — are going to lose everything?" said Skelly. "Enough is enough."

I mean just look at this RUDE queer trying to use facts and logic to make the case that he's being fucked over by the POLITE government lead by Doug Ford. As a fellow Canadian, I am embarrassed by the level of RUDEness on display here.

Skelly went on to complain about a lack of supporting evidence from the Ford government for closing small businesses, and about the fact that large chains have been allowed to stay open despite being rammed with people.

"I complied with the two weeks to flatten the curve. I complied again during the 'second wave' when we locked down, when Doug Ford promised us that there would be supporting evidence to shut down the restaurants, bars and gyms," he said.

"The data from Toronto Public Health that came out two weeks ago shows that two of the over 10,000 Ontario COVID deaths were linked to bars, restaurants and retail. So why are we getting we getting singled out? And the big multinational corporations are all essential while they're packed?"

How dare this filthy Peasant question the actions of the government? Of course it's just pure happenstance that Billionaires have collectively added almost a trillion dollars to their net worths. Just pure happenstance their goy, don't you dare RUDELY question the actions of the State-Corporate Complex. 

That's it for now, lots more has happened here, and it's all angering/funny.
