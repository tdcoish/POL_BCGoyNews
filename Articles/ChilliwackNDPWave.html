TDC_ARTICLE_START
Election night in two of the tightest campaigns in B.C. – Chilliwack and Chilliwack-Kent – ended the way it began, fraught with uncertainty.

But it appears the New Democrats have taken both ridings, long-held BC Liberal territory.

Incumbent BC Liberals John Martin in Chilliwack and Laurie Throness in Chilliwack-Kent were always up against a big challenge, the former because of a right-of-centre vote-splitting problem with BC Conservative Diane Janzen, and the latter with his removal from the BC Liberal caucus for controversial comments.

There was a multi-hour delay in ballot box counting, but at the end of the night, with all 82 ballot boxes reported, the NDP’s Dan Coulter looks to be the winner with 4,575 votes cast (38.39 per cent) compared to BC Liberal John Martin with 3,511 (29.46 per cent), followed by Janzen’s 2,189 (18.37 per cent). Green candidate Tim Cooper had 10.86 per cent or 1,294 votes, with Independent Josue Anderson earning 205 votes over Libertarian Andrew Coombes and his 144.

For a quick backstory here. Diane Janzen was running because both parties were ignoring that Downtown Chilliwack has basically been turned into a shithole, full of crime and drug addicts. She ran with the BC Conservatives, and lost. And no, there is nothing bad about her "giving the NDP the win," because we want to destroy the Donor-Center Party in order to make room for us. If we can make these Parties non-viable, voters will vote for us instead.

Upstart Independent Jason Lum, a Chilliwack city councillor, received a remarkable 3,842 votes or nearly 25 per cent of votes cast on election day, not enough to contend but a large number given the inherent hurdles facing independent candidates in provincial elections in B.C.

Interestingly, Green candidate Jeff Hammersmark who confused voters and confounded his own party by coming out to say that people should vote for Lum and not him, received 1,326 votes or 8.49 per cent. Libertarian Eli Gagné earned 239 votes.

As you can tell by the Green Party endorsement, Jason Lum is a piece of shit, with no difference between him and any of the other Donor-Puppets. He just wanted a new career path, having been a Chilliwack City Councillor for 9 years.

Anyway, vote splitting is great, and repeats what I have said for a long time. We can make whichever party we choose, the one that lies about economics, or the one that lies about social issues, lose elections simply by getting about 5-10% of the vote. In fact, if we even get 5-10% of the vote in key ridings, we can destroy the party of our choosing. I would choose the BC Liberals of course.
