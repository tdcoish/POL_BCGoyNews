This is an important story from Summer 2019. Since I wasn't around then, I have to print it now.

A B.C. human rights lawyer who specializes in the rights of trans people says a recent B.C. human rights tribunal decision, which found a trans woman was not discriminated against when denied Brazilian-waxing services, is a step backward for trans people and an example of their need for pro-bono and “low-bono” legal services.

Adrienne Smith is a Vancouver lawyer whose practice mostly consists of drug policy and human rights cases including name changes, gender-change applications, employment, access to services and other matters affecting trans people. Smith says the B.C. Human Rights Tribunal had a recent record of wins for the trans community.

Ah yes, "Adrienne" Smith. The BC NDP's "pride ambassador" back in 2017. One of the most malicious people in this country, he has also been big on drug policy. Big on... keeping drugs legal and on the street, so that people can overdose and die. Here's a great quote if you want to understand him better.

Adrienne Smith is a transgender human rights activist and drug policy lawyer. They recently settled a BC Supreme Court case which guaranteed access to opiate replacement therapy for prisoners in BC jails. Adrienne appeared at the BC Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada where they argued about the deleterious effects of mandatory minimum sentences for women, indigenous people, and drug users.

Yep, it's really important for this disgusting malicious pervert to give legal privileges to women, abos, and druggies. It would really appreciate it if there are lots of criminal abos and druggies out on the streets, because it is a spiteful mutant, who hates normal people for socially rejecting it it's entire life.

Now, back to the Canadian Lawyer Mag article.

“This case really overturns that process. And I think it does so because the applicant didn't have the benefit of counsel, which highlights the whole problem of Legal Aid funding for human rights matters in British Columbia and arguably across the country,” they say.

Yeah, no. So this the Jessica "Wax my female balls, bigot" Yaniv case, where this crazy jew guy who thinks he's a woman goes around to female beauticians offering brazilian waxes, and demands that they wax his balls. No really, his balls. This guy didn't even go through the routine of actually chopping his dick off, he's still got the package and everything. 

When the poor women refuse to do this, he then hauls them into the "Human Rights Tribunals" where they, even if winning, have to pay legal fees that will destroy their businesses. But remember, trannies are the ones who are oppressed, because the little people don't like them.

In Yaniv v. Various Waxing Salons (No. 2), 2019 BCHRT 222 (CanLII), Jessica Yaniv brought human rights complaints against seven waxing services Yaniv claimed violated s. 8(1) of the Human Rights Code, by denying services on the basis of her gender identity or expression.

The tribunal ruled against Yaniv, in part because it found her motivation in bringing the complaints was not merely to advance trans rights but also for her own financial gain and animosity towards the immigrant groups of which the respondents were a part.

The tribunal ruled against Yaniv because the case was such an embarrassment to the perverts. They then tried to save the narrative, by pretending that Yaniv just hated Asians or something, which everyone knew was retarded.

During the hearings, Yaniv was on social media commenting on the case and making racist remarks against immigrants, things any lawyer would have prevented Yaniv from doing, says Smith. Smith also says, as waxing services are important to trans women, the community would had been better served had a different waxing case been put forward. The case had “unfortunate facts,” was “poorly thought out” and Yaniv wasn’t advised on how to behave properly, they say.

A rehash of the above, but I find it pretty hilarious how the article keeps using "they." Whomever wrote this has no idea what this oppressor wants to be called, so they just call them "they," hedging their bets.

“There's a human rights bar in British Columbia that's working very hard to advance trans rights in the province,” Smith says. “… It's going to put a chill on trans rights human rights litigation in British Columbia.”

At first I had no idea what this meant, but I looked into it, and the Canadian Bar Association of BC is indeed a purveyor of Pervertism. I'll have another article on that upcoming.
TDC_ARTICLE_START
Yaniv had originally filed complaints against 13 waxing services, but a number of the complaints were dropped. Cousineau split the remaining complaints into two categories: Brazilian-waxing and leg- and arm-waxing. The Brazilian waxing complaints were dismissed because the service Yaniv was requesting was not one customarily provided to the public by the respondents, which is a necessary factor in applying to s. 8 of the Code. The respondents brought in an expert on waxing services who testified that Brazilian waxing is contingent on the customer having a vulva, while waxing a scrotum was called a “brozilian” or “manzilian.” The two procedures are different in technique and Cousineau added that a person “must actively and specifically consent” to provide a service which requires handling a “stranger’s genitals for a prolonged period of time.”

Literally "wax my female nutsack." I reprinted this just for the LOLs. And no, the above is not what lost Yaniv his case. Let me just repeat this for you. Yaniv's ballsack not being a vagina IS NOT WHAT LOST HIM THIS CASE ACCORDING TO THE TOTALLY LEGITIMATE TRIBUNAL.
TDC_ARTICLE_START
In the arm- and leg-waxing complaints, Cousineau said she would “likely have found at least one of the complaints justified.” But the motivation to confront discrimination was overpowered by Yaniv’s “dominant or overriding purposes” in bringing the complaints for racist purposes.

“It should go without saying that human rights complaints underlain by a racist agenda are antithetical to the Code’s purposes,” said Cousineau in her decision.

Yes, Yaniv being mean to brown people is what lost him his case, not his abuse of wahmens. Not the absurdity of "wax my female ballsack." No, being mean to brown people on twatter.

If you're wondering who HRT member Devyn Cousineau is, here's a picture of her.

In the Bill Whatcott case she outright told him that "truth is irrelevant," which I have to admit, is a refreshingly honest statement from the privileged class. More on her and the Canadian Bar Association later.
