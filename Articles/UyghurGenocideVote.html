OTTAWA – The House of Commons voted Monday to formally label the Chinese government’s actions against the Uyghur people a genocide, a move likely to draw a strong rebuke from Beijing, one of Canada’s former ambassadors warned.

The non-binding Conservative motion called on the government to denounce the genocide and urged the International Olympic Committee to move the 2022 Winter Games from Beijing.

The Liberal cabinet, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, abstained from the vote or simply failed to show. But the motion received otherwise unanimous support passing 266 to 0, with many backbench Liberals MPs voting in favour.

I don't think I'll be able to write another article on this, because it is just so fucking gay. Sure, the <a href="../Articles/COVID_OntarioHealthOfficialRealVictim.html">Government intentionally destroyed small businesses</a> with arbitrary CovidCHAN "lockdown" rules. Sure, young people nowadays have negative net worth. Sure, we've got the Tranny Industrial Complex targetting children for "puberty blockers," article to come soon. Sure, we've got something called the "UBC Social Justice Institute," talking about <a href="../Articles/UBC_SJI_QueerOfColourTheorizing.html">Queer of Colour Theorizing</a>. And sure, even WRT China, we have hundreds of thousands of our jobs shipped overseas to them and others, along with much of our real estate being bought up by billionaires from China and elsewhere. NOT PROBLEMS!

The real thing that the Conservative Party of Canada needs to be doing is pointing out that Joffrey Trudeau, while condemning CHYNA, ISN'T CONDEMNING THEM HARD ENOUGH WHAT A MONSTER!!!!!!

The Uyghurs are a Muslim minority group in the Xinjiang region of China. Multiple human rights groups and journalists have documented widespread abuse of the Uyghurs including massive detention camps, arbitrary violence, forced sterilization and sexual violence directed against Uyghur women.

Oh, well if multiple unnamed "human rights groups," and "journalists," claim atrocities are happening in a supposedly enemy country then it must be true. See Weapons of Mass Destruction, Iraqis throwing Kuwaitti babies on the ground, Assad gassing his own wahmen and babies, Iran being "12 months away from nuclear weapons," back in 2004, the people of Venezuela "rising up in favour of Pool Boy Juan," a CIA asset with literally 0 votes ever received, and many others.

Guy Saint-Jacques, Canada’s former ambassador to China, said the government in Beijing will likely show its displeasure because it wants to send a message to other nations.

“China is very concerned that Western countries will get together and declare that genocide is taking place,” he said. “(China) may want to impose sanctions, further sanctions on Canada, so as to warn other countries that would want to do the same thing that they will pay a price.”

Translation: This is bad for Canadians. Yet for (((some reason))) the government maintains cordial relationships with the actual genocidal jew ethnostate of Occupied Palestine, despite their numerous actual atrocities. 
<img src="../Images/israeliAtrocities3.jpg">
So Canadians get to suffer economically in a purely cynical power play for CHYNA. And as <a href="https://national-justice.com/international-finances-anti-china-crusade">National-Justice</a> has noted, this is being lead by (((International Finance))). There is absolutely nothing in this for you, they're just trying to put pressure on China to allow foreign, mostly jew, plutocrats into China to make money off of looting the Chinese Peasants.

Guy Saint-Jacques, Canada’s former ambassador to China, said the Chinese, for instance, didn’t understand why the Liberal government couldn’t simply order Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou released following her arrest. He said the Chinese system doesn’t separate between courts, parliaments and government.

Wow, I wonder why the Chinese got that idea? Could it maybe be that they don't for one second believe in the totally bullshit "muh separation of powers," propaganda that is aimed at the oppressed goy-peasants in this country? How could they possibly come to such a ridiculous conclusion, to think that the supposedly powerful here in Canada couldn't just order Meng Wanzhou to be released from jail? So crazy for the slanty eyes to think that.

“They may want to put more pressure on Canada by imposing tariffs on Canadian products that they can source elsewhere,” he said. “They will have to think about where they want to hurt us. And again, it will be a warning to other countries that if you dare to go this route, you will pay a price as well.”

In 2018, not long after Wanzhou’s arrest, in addition to detaining Kovrig and Spavor, the Chinese government imposed export restrictions on Canadian canola.

Brian Innes, vice president of public affairs with the Canola Council of Canada, said that continues to hit Canadian farmers.

“Since canola seed exports were blocked almost two years ago, our exports of canola seed to China have been down 50 to 70 per cent,” he said in an email. “This has lowered prices, and, in turn, reduced the amount of canola grown by farmers.”

The council declined to comment on Monday’s vote, but said exports of the oilseed have fallen from $2.8 billion in 2018, before the restrictions, to $800 million in 2019 and $1.4 billion in 2020.

So we're hurting our industries just to put pressure on China for (((International Finance Plutocrats))).

Conservative leader Erin O’Toole said he is aware there will be consequences of the vote in Parliament, but said that shouldn’t stop Canada from acting.

“There’s already some security risks and trade disruption risks with China but that shouldn’t deter us doing what is right.”

O’Toole said Trudeau’s absence on the vote is an appalling failure of his leadership.

“We call on the Trudeau government to show up for work on human rights and stop their naive approach to China. The Liberal government needs to stand up for what is right” he said.

He said Trudeau should begin by recognizing the motion in Parliament, call for the Olympics to be moved and start working with allies to apply more pressure on the Chinese government.

Alright, I've decided that this really will be the last I write on this. For future reference, I'm going to write a little TL:DR so that everyone can understand what's going on.

1) The hatred for China is <a href="https://national-justice.com/international-finances-anti-china-crusade">purely because of their unwillingness to allow foreign plutocrats to rape their people</a>. On top of this, they've been helping Iran circumvent U.S. Sanctions, so Jew Nationalists are really assmad at this.
2) The Arrest and Detainment of Meng Wanzhou was so fake/political it was actually hilarious, as I detailed in my <a href="../Articles/VanMountieSuggestArrestMengWanzhou.html">article</a> on the situation.
3) There is absolutely no evidence of "muh Uyghur Genocide," although I'll edit this when I write an article on that. Long story short, it's hilariously fake.
4) Despite not being popular, all Donor-Funded Political Parties are 100% in support of Jew Nationalists/International Finance Billionaires (although I repeat myself) goals of making China/Iran bend the knee, for absolutely nothing to do with this fake genocide.
5) The actual real genocide of Palestinian Goyim will not be getting denounced, goy.
6) Tech Companies also support this because China can make cheaper phones and other products than them.
7) There isn't just nothing here for you, if you are in one of the many industries harmed by China's retaliatory tariffs, such as Canola Farmers, you are being hurt by this. Those farmers have lost 2+ billion dollars in sales due to this, as but one example.
8) The Donor-Right are pretending to do this whole "muh Trudeau not TOUGH on China," which is such a Finkelfight I just can't even.

So yes, this is entirely fake, this is entirely gay.
