Below is me reprinting something I wrote on CoronaChan all the way back in March of 2020. I'm reprinting it here for posterity, and because it's still very much true.

-----------------------------------------------
Part of the irritation with getting down into the weeds with the day to day horseshit of politics is that we can lose sight of the bigger picture. I've put together a sort of overview of what a competent, ie. fascist, government would do if they were running the USA.

BEFORE THE VIRUS EVEN STARTS

An economic system where people coughing in China destroys your economy is totally insane. Same goes for Russia and Saudi Arabia's oil price war destroying the oil industry in America. Jazzhands keeps harping on this, but we should harp on it even more. A system this fragile is a garbage system, and it is so obviously garbage that we cannot assume anything less than malice from its creators. While complete autarky is not needed, America easily has the ability for essential autarky, being able to run necessary infrastructure, produce electricity, grow and deliver food, and other essential tasks. Borders being closed should not kill anyone, and it shouldn't destroy your economy.
An economic system relying on debt slavery is feudalism, and obviously unworkable.
The government has to be able to cope with a pandemic. Holy shit, the fucking incompetence here is astounding. It's not just a question of will, I don't believe that our government has the expertise to deal with a pandemic even if they wanted to. Regardless of why though, the response has been de-legitimizing of our government, and this should be said to normies.
AFTER THE VIRUS STARTS IN WUHAN, BUT NOT HERE

Intelligence services should be actually informing us about the shit going on in other countries. Relying on the Chinese Communist Party being 100% truthful is totally insane and incompetent. However, they're much too busy hoaxing "White SUPREEEMACIST TERRORIST SHOOTINGS" to bother doing what the peasants think their job is supposed to be.
Borders closed immediately. American citizens get to come back, but have to go into makeshift quarantine hospitals, where they are monitored for the disease. None of this "go home and infect your family but stay home" shit. Seriously, that is so fucking ridiculous. I have a cousin who is forced to quarantine with her family after getting back from a trip. Her family is free to go wherever they want. I mean, how the fuck does that make any sense at all?
Actually get tests that fucking work. And until test do work, we're going to have to assume that the virus has broken out here.
Accurate models of the infectivity (word?) of the disease, as well as the mortality rate for all age groups must be known. Until then, the virus must be assumed to have an extremely high mortality rate and contagion rate.
AFTER THE VIRUS OUTBREAKS HERE

Total shutdown, unless accurate models of the disease  mortality/contagion show that it is GENUINELY not a serious pandemic that requires urgent action. Or if it is deemed that the borders closing sufficiently stopped the virus.
Immediate freeze of all payments. Debt/rent/utilities/etcetera.
House arrest/quarantine is fine. Government must go around delivering essential food products/rations, as well as providing power.
Anyone displaying symptoms has a hotline to a government office, which will come to the person, quarantine them in a van while testing is done, and only release them back if tests are negative.
If someone test positive, then they are immediately taken to a makeshift hospital, where they are given proper care. Alternatively, the Chinese model of a special door for sick patients and a special part of a pre-existing hospital for the sick patients, will also work.
AFTER THE VIRUS HAS PASSED

If all of the above had been done, we could simply get back to life as if nothing had happened. We wouldn't have to give 6 trillion of your money to (((capitalists))).
I get a tiny bit frustrated with the day to day discussion on CoronaChan. Not so much here, but especially on twitter. You may notice, that while I'm not against UBI, it's actually totally unnecessary, with a real fascist response. If the government is enforcing quarantine, but providing you with essential services and food and freezing payments, you don't need any UBI. An alternative strategy would be to shut down 90% of public life, and then give people UBI so they could go out and get takeout and buy stuff at supermarkets, but that's a fake and gay capitalist "solution" that would still lead to massively more infections.

You will also notice that nowhere do I say that "self-quarantine" should be undertaken. If you are a high risk, the government should quarantine you after your plane lands or boat docks. The idea that you can be infecting family members, who are themselves allowed to go outside is totally unserious. It's better than nothing, but barely.

So TL:DR, all this is fake and gay. It's even faker and gayer than you think. The only solution is here is fascist, and they don't want to do that for a variety of reasons, none of which include even a mild concern with your wellbeing. You are a peasant who exists to be exploited by these people, and they are already making the most out of this by giving 6 trillion to capitalists.
-----------------------------------------------
Well, I guess with hindsight, we can see that it was even faker and gayer than previously anticipated. From <a href="../Articles/COVID_OntarioHealthOfficialRealVictim.html">government officials closing down barbershops then playing the victim</a>, to the <a href="../Articles/COVID_QuarantineHotels.html">absolute joke our quarantine hotels are to the Chinese</a>, to the <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/non-essential-travel-truck-drivers-covid-19-test-border-1.5910888">truckers being allowed to go down to the US, then come back without quarantine</a>, despite making up almost half of all Canada-US border traffic, I couldn't have predicted exactly the ways the response would be fake, only that it would be fake. And let's not forget the story about my cousing being forced to quarantine with her family, thus infecting them, while they were allowed to go outside with no repercussions.

TL:DR: 
1) A serious Corporate-State Complex would have prepared dried food/other services in case of natural disaster, war, or pandemic.
2) That our economy has been structured to be dependent on foreign labour is completely indefensible.
3) Complete autarky is not needed, but essential service autarky absolutely is.
4) The Corporate-State Response was to go "muh wacism," and keep the borders open.
5) The sheer incompetence WRT getting working tests was amazing.
6) Intelligence services should be getting accurate info out of China, instead of being busy gay-op'ing White People.
7) Borders closed immediately.
8) Makeshift Quarantine Hospitals would be built, just like they did in China. Same for crematoriums.
9) Governmental services to provide food/other to those affected by quarantine should be a given.
10) Forcing people to "quarantine," with their family, but letting their families go out... is hilariously stupid and fake.
11) Having some actual experts to give actual estimations of the infectivity/mortality of the disease is a given.
12) A complete and total shutdown of the truly non-essential economy should be possible, and should have been enacted.
13) Complete freeze of payments. Debt/rent/utilities/etcetera. 
14) Anyone displaying symptoms has a hotline to a government office, which will come pick them up in person, quarantine them in a van during testing, and only release them if tests are negative. Basically, the China model.
15) If all that had been done, life would have gone back to normal, as it mostly has in China itself.
16) There was absolutely no need to give massive bailouts to (((billionaires))), but that part everyone knows.
17) Masks would themselves be fine if the Corporate-State Complex was actually taking this seriously, albeit not really mattering one way or another.
18) Apparently SCIENCE! has proven if you're in a BLM or Antifa riot, you are totally immune to getting COVID.
19) The LOLbertarian "muh freeeedom, muh meeeaaassks," bullshit is really annoying, not popular, and counterproductive.
20) No, truckers don't get to cross the borders just cause. However, they get very well compensated for not being able to do this.
