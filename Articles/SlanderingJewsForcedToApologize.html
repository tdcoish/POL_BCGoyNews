A Warsaw court has ordered two prominent historians to apologise to an elderly woman who claimed they had defamed her late uncle, in a case seen as critical to independent Holocaust research in Poland.
Prof Jan Grabowski of the University of Ottawa and Prof Barbara Engelking of the Polish Center for Holocaust Research were accused of defaming Edward Malinowski, a wartime mayor, by suggesting he gave up Jews to Nazi Germans.

Accused and convicted of this, I might add. I'm going to print most of this article, just so you know that at no point do they ever actually, you know, provide any proof of their claims. Then again, when you've been allowed to make false accusations for so long, the burden of proof feels like oppression.

-the researchers were told to apologise for a passage in Night Without End: The Fate of Jews in Selected Counties of Occupied Poland, a 1,600-page work they co-edited, which the court said “violated Malinowski’s honour” by “providing inaccurate information”.

The charges against Grabowski and Engelkring were condemned by the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem, which said they amounted to “an attack on the effort to achieve a full and balanced picture of the history of the Holocaust”.

Other historical institutions also strongly criticised the case, including the Paris-based Foundation for the Memory of the Shoah, which called it a “witch-hunt” and a “pernicious invasion into the very heart of research”.

Leszczynska, 81, had demanded 100,000 zlotys (€22,300) in damages and a public apology from the historians for allegedly defaming her uncle, the wartime mayor of Malinowo village in north-east Poland.

Leszczynska said the mayor, who was acquitted of collaboration in 1950, aided Jews and the book contained “omissions and methodological errors”. She was backed by the Polish Anti-Defamation League, which aims to “defend Poland’s good name”.

The League, which has close ties to the Polish government and in the past received state grants, argued that the two researchers were guilty of “defiling the good name” of a Polish hero and, by extension, harming the dignity and pride of all Poles.

Goyim it's just so damn beautiful. I love it. I absolutely love it.

Maciej Świrski, the organisation’s head, said before the trial that academic research “has to be conducted with probity” and criticised “attempts at establishing an academic consensus on Polish co-responsibility for the Holocaust”.

Leszczynska’s lawyer, Monika Brzozowska-Pasieka, denied the case was aimed at opening up new avenues for litigation. “We say the authors violated Filomena’s rights by identifying her uncle as an accomplice, as a murderer, simply,” she said.

Critics have accused Poland’s government of trying to whitewash cases of complicity in the genocide of Jews under Nazi occupation. In 2018, it passed a law making it a civil offence to falsely blame the Polish nation or state for Holocaust crimes, dropping a plan to criminalise the offence only after an international outcry.

Last week Katarzyna Markusz, a journalist, was questioned by police on suspicion of “slandering the Polish nation”, a crime carrying a penalty of up to three years in prison, for writing that “Polish participation in the Holocaust is a historical fact”.

Oh my fucking god this is just so perfect. Some lying kikes get BTFO'd, and then a propagandist gets up to three years in prison. Oh god it's just so beautiful. You love to see it.

Engelking said in a pre-trial statement that the real aim of the case had been “to question the credibility and competence of the people accused ... and to have a dissuasive effect, specifically to discourage other researchers from finding out the truth of the Holocaust in Poland”.

Hey goys, jews are really upset that people might be discouraged from finding out the truth about the Lampshadocaust. That's why they try to throw anyone who fact checks them in jail.
