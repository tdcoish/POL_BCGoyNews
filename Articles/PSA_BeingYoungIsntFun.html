I have a lot of criticisims of Richard Spencer. All of them can be boiled down to: he's a terrible advocate for White People, and he doesn't appear to care at all about the rank and file. I don't think he was perfect, but one thing he said stuck with me for a long time. Especially in combination with Milo "Miles of Black Cock" Yiannopolous. Milo said "young people nowadays know that being young isn't as fun as it's supposed to be," back in 2016. At around that time, Spencer said something to the effect of:
TDC_ARTICLE_START
Back in the 1960's, what you were supposed to do was find some nice girl, settle down, start a family with her. Maybe go off to college first, but even in college, you were supposed to find a nice girl and do that. The degeneracy back then was some guy who had some dead end job, and had two girls, one around each arm. Maybe they weren't the nicest girls, or even the cutest, but they were "fun" kind of girls. Nowadays the degeneracy is some extremely overweight, lonely guy in his late 30's, jerking off to extremely weird cartoon animal porn all by himself on the internet. The degeneracy has become degenerate.
TDC_ARTICLE_STOP
Spencer didn't say that as eloquently as I did, but the gist of it was there. The degeneracy is degenerate. Imagine what could have been called degenerate back in the 1950's. Imagine your parents telling you to go to university, or work in some factory, but you instead save up enough money with your minimum wage job to go travel to France. There you meet some girl who barely speaks English, but, let's be honest, there's some physical attraction going on. You like each other. You take her to a cafe. She orders for you, because you can't speak French. You realize that you don't have enough money to pay for your meal, and as your eyes hit hers, no words are spoken and she realizes this as well. 

The two of you leap out the door, energized by the paranoid notion that the cafe employees are watching your every move. You sprint down one block, then another, and another, with fear induced speed, as if 10,000 cops are ready to chase you down and catch you. Finally, after even the adrenaline can't hide your exhaustion, and running 10x farther than needed, you collapse onto a beautiful patch of grass in the beautiful city. Panting, sweating, you giggle together, as your eyes meet. As you look into each others eyes, an animalistic passion overcomes you. Your lips meet hers...

You know technically that story is degenerate. You don't focus on your career/education. Instead you go travel to Paris. You meet a girl, and instead of intellectually appreciating her, you find her hot. You don't pay for your meal, like a criminal. Finally, you, dare I say, make out with a girl you barely know, and whom you are not betrothed to. And yet, it seems kind of... innocent? Maybe even quaint.

Being young isn't any fun anymore, and the young people I know, aged ~16-24, I can tell are even less fun than we were back then. Even when I was young it was already something of a fading memory to have being young be fun, but it was still kind of fun. It was still kind of an adventure. I've always used my real name, Timothy Coish, on the internet. First, I used it because LOL at anyone giving a shit on the internet. Back in 2006, when I was just 14 years old, I said whatever the fuck I wanted on YouTube. Those were the days, and while I want far more for young people nowadays, I almost feel guilt, that teenagers now have never experienced what it's like to have a free, open internet. To say nothing of what I missed out on. 

I was going to write this to point out that a secret service that is provided by the "Rules Guy," as in the "No sex before marriage," guy, is that there is a certain kind of thrill to breaking the rules. Back when I was just 6 years old, I remember we had these laminated nametags on our desks. Some of the kids picked at the tags, and one day our teacher said, as she left the class to go make photocopies or something, "please don't pick at your nametags." Seconds after she left, my six year old gaze met the six year old gaze of the kid next to me, and with a rush of adrenaline and excitement he started picking at his nametag, I being too nervous to touch mine, but loving being part of this transgression. It lasted just a few seconds, but we had that conspiratorial thrill long after the teacher had come back to class and resumed the lesson.

When the society says "no sex before marriage," then having sex with your fiance a month before marriage becomes an incredibly exciting endeavour. When society has relaxed this until having sex with your fiance is fine, it's no longer exciting. Instead, having sex with your girlfriend who you are about to propose to is the new exciting. There is a sort of conservation of transgressional excitement, so that the new normal becomes just as boring as the old normal.

The acceptable degeneracy has outpaced the desires of normal people. I don't particularly want whatever weird sexual fetish I would need to want to be "transgressive," nowadays. I just want a sweet girl who I can dine and dash with once in my life, just to say I did, and then have normal, sweet, intimacy with. But I would also like it if I could feel like a rebel fighting against the man when I do that, not as an almost quaint throwback.

This isn't really here nor there, I just wanted to let something out that's somewhat close to the heart. I don't want to make this entirely about specific, tangible politics of the day, because taking a step back and looking at the larger picture can often be quite productive.
