I do not say this lightly, but I think I may have stumbled onto the single most Anti-White Propaganda Piece that I have ever read. Now there's definitely competition, but it's a challenge to not simply quote the entire piece in full.

The Edmonton Public School Board is condemning a “white alliance” student group connected to Strathcona High School that appeared on social media over the weekend.

The Scona White Student Alliance Instagram page made its first post on Sunday, Feb. 14, where it announced that “white lives matter,” a phrase that has been tied to white nationalism and hate groups.

“Strathcona High School has been increasingly anti-white rather than pro-black for the past few months,” the post said. “We are all equal and race should be ignored, we must judge each other by our actions, not by the color of our skin.”

Well not quite, here's the full statement above, repeated below.

"White Lives Matter! Strathcona High School has been increasingly anti-White rather than pro black for the past few months. We have been forced to sit in our classes and listen to some clowns ranting how terrible and racist are all Whites. Enough is enough, us students don't wish to be thought any of that social justice rubbish, we just want to be treated equally and be respected. Black people shouldn't be treated superior to white people, nor the other way around. We are all equal and race should be ignored, we must judge each other by our actions, not by the colour of our skin."

First, let me say, congratulations to whomever wrote that post. I applaud their courage and bravery. It takes a lot of guts to stand up against oppression, and for that I am thankful.

I would definitely have stuck far more to the "I am being attacked for being White angle," though. Giving examples is great, and makes things far harder for Anti-Whites to deny.

The Edmonton Public School Board said it was “made aware of this social media account over the weekend,” but told Global News Tuesday that it did not yet know who created the account.

“The school has reported the account and has made Edmonton Police Service aware of it as well,” a statement from the board to Global News said. “There is zero tolerance for hate-filled accounts and posts like this.”

Trisha Estabrooks, the school board chair, said Tuesday that she believes the post highlights the need to fight “systemic racism in our education systems.”

“We can’t shy away from having these tough conversations in our classrooms, in our schools, and in our broader society,” Estabrooks said. “This is an opportunity to have those tough conversations.”

Lol, get a load of this catlady. Although this is almost too vicious to be funny at all. Imagine calling the police on a White Student who points out he's being racially attacked. Imagine thinking that someone who does this can be allowed to serve on a school board with power over White Children. If I was a White Student in an Edmonton School, I would not feel safe with this insane, incensed Non-Player Character in a position of power over me.

Students at Strathcona High School spoke out against the account on Tuesday afternoon.

“It’s really disheartening to see,”  said student Ethan Loyer. “I was kind of personally upset because that’s not how I want to see our school represented.

“I think there should certainly be consequences for their actions,” he said. “I do not think that’s a fair way at all to represent their school. Especially seeing our school’s logo being used on the account.”

“The person who was behind that was a coward,” said Grade 11 student Semi Wohlgemuth. “Guaranteed they would probably not say that in real life.”

I couldn't find pictures of Ethan Loyer or Semi Wohlgemuth, so I had to put up the dysgenic Darrel Robertson instead. Regardless, the point is that this guy has also made anti-White statements, specifically about "muh BIPOC (black, indigenous, coloured people), muh BIPOC students need to feel safe". I swear to fucking god, there's been one single anti-White Propaganda Piece ever written, the rest are just copying from it.

Estrabrooks said a similar Twitter account had also been started but has since shut down. She said it is “disappointing” that the Instagram was still active as of Tuesday afternoon.

“The fact that it existed, the fact that it is harmful, the fact that it is blatantly racist, even if it had a small spread, doesn’t take away the fact that this was done, and it has an impact.”

"Muh Disappointment." "Muh Harm." "Blatantly Racist".

The school also sent an update letter from its principal Hans Van Ginhoven to parents at the school Tuesday after an initial one was sent on the weekend.

“Today, there were conversations throughout the school about who we want to be, how we can do and be better, and ensure our BIPOC students feel part of this community,” the letter Tuesday read.

“This is ongoing work and with your support, I know we will make steps in the right direction.”

The letter also said that the school “engaged Edmonton Police Service to look into this account.”

Edmonton Police Service engaged to look into this account. I was trying to write a humourous article, but frankly, these people need to be made examples of. Everything else was just kind of funny. This deserves retribution.

The letter also said that the school “engaged Edmonton Police Service to look into this account.”

Edmonton police commented on one of the posts through one of its official accounts and said the Hate Crimes Unit has been “made aware” of the group and would be following up.

The solutions to this are mostly for private discussion. However, I am going to call into the Edmonton "Hate Crimes" division and investigate this, just like I did with the WVPD "Skidmark of Hate" Crosswalk Incident.

Another post on the account showed a video of Black activist Martin Luther King during his famous “I Have A Dream” speech in 1963, where King pushed for the end of racism.

Kind of cringey, but I sort of get it. I don't expect 17 year olds to be political geniuses.

“Society is being dominated by victimhood and anti-white racism, we are slowly regressing back to the starting point where others are treated differently based on the color of their skin,” the post said. “Our school has been doing the exact same thing, we are facing straight up racism against white people in our school.”

Racism is an anti-White slur. However, once again, I'm not going to sperg out about this. Anyone fighting against an Anti-White curriculum is doing God's work. I am extremely encouraged that they didn't go for some Boomer-Tier "Muh Dems R Real Racists." Or "You're REALLY hurting black people because of muh low expectations." Or "Muh Woke Left. SOCIALISM". For that they need to be praised.

The white alliance Instagram account also posted an update on Monday where it said there have been “many violent threats” sent in to the group and threatened legal action.

On Tuesday night, someone from the Scona White Student Alliance account provided a statement to Global News but declined to disclose their identity, citing the threats they claim have been made against them.

In the statement, the person(s) behind the account said they want the school to end what they called an “anti-white” curriculum and to acknowledge the existence of “reverse racism,” a theory that the Alberta Civil Liberties Research Centre says is a myth. In the statement, the person(s) behind the account also reiterated the phrase “all lives matter,” a term that many have described as being hurtful.

First things first, of course the Propagandist here, Allison Branch, doesn't bother actually printing the statement. She, on behalf of her employers, needs the NPC's reading this to get her filtered non-reality. It refuses to print out said violent threats, which everybody knows are true. It then tried to doxxx the brave literal high schoolers in that group, pushing back against Institutional Anti-Whitism, in an attempt to oppress them. Moreover, they then laughably cite the Alberta Civil Liberties Research Center as an authority. Then again, <a href="../Articles/CalculatingWarPropagandistKillCount.html">these are the propagandists who lied us into Iraq and Afghanistan</a>, so really, what could I have expected, honesty?

The comments section, despite many comments mentioning further censorship by Globo News, are a true barometer on where the People are.
<img src="../Images/EDM_Comments.PNG">
One of them, as you can see, mentions that there is a "Black Alliance Group" at the school, something failed to be mentioned in the article. An article written by this broad.

I need to contact this group and get the full statement. Someone needs to print it.
