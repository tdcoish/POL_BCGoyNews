I'm writing this series of articles on the BC Liberal Party about a month later than I should be. But better late than never.

Andrew Wilkinson announced Monday that he will step down as leader of the BC Liberals, following his party’s projected loss in Saturday’s provincial election.

In an extremely brief statement, he said he will stay on until a new leader is chosen.

The party’s executive council is set to meet over the weekend to discuss a leadership race.

I've written about Andrew Wilkinson quite a bit before. He had a nice <a href="../Articles/BCLiberalsCuckOwnCandidate.html">history</a> of throwing his own candidates the bus for violating imaginary faux pas, like calling women attractive, or attacking the NDP a little bit too hard. Really, he was a <a href="../Articles/AndrewWilkinsonBigFag.html">particularly uninspiring</a> puppet, who gave people absolutely zero reason to vote for him. 

So they didn't.

Concerns were raised about his leadership mid-campaign, including from the party’s own membership chair, Nicole Paul.

Paul fired off a series of Tweets on Oct. 15 after MLA incumbent Laurie Throness resigned from the party over comments he made comparing the BC NDP’s free birth control plan to eugenics.

“I continue to stand by the values of free enterprise that originally drew me to this party. The BC Liberal Party under Andrew Wilkinson does not reflect values I support,” she wrote.

“I am pleased to see Laurie Throness will no longer be a candidate or caucus member. This is action that any reasonable leader would have acted on months, if not years ago.”

Throness has drawn criticism in the past for his anti-LGBTQ2 views. He ran as an independent on Saturday in Chilliwack-Kent and his race has yet to finalized.

Spoiler Warning: Throness lost his election as an independent in a very close race. A race that he almost certainly would have won had the Liberals not kicked him out. I think this is a great moment to repeat to people who are deeply invested in the Donor Puppet Fight, you are more concerned with "your" side winning, than "your" side is.

As far as "drawn criticism," I thought I had written up an article on this earlier, but apparently not. He did some whiny cuckservative "this NDP contraception plan sounds like Eugenics and that's bad waaah," bullshit that literally nobody asked for, yet was way too extreme for Andrew Wilkinson's donors, so he was given the boot. Now his career is probably over. 

Again, notice how pleased these people are with kicking him out, despite this almost assuredly costing them a seat? Do you see how fake this system is, goy? Again, if you care about this, you are more invested in this Puppet Show than the Puppets.
