It appears the Vancouver Canucks have fired their longtime national anthem singer in response to reports he will be singing at a rally organized by COVID-19 deniers and anti-mask advocates.

On Friday afternoon, the Vancouver Sun reported that Mark Donnelly had agreed to perform at a Saturday event in Vancouver protesting COVID-19 restrictions.

Not long after, hockey team owner Francesco Aquilini tweeted at the newspaper to request a change in the headline from "Canucks anthem singer" to "former Canucks anthem singer."

Mark Donnelly is an opera singer who gets plenty of work. He's also a fairly well off man, at least according to networthpost.org, where his net worth is <a href="https://networthpost.org/net-worth/mark-donnelly-net-worth-9/">estimated at 11 million.</a> So sure, this isn't awful as some blue collar guy getting fired from his job by some Antifa Capitalist-Colluder, but this definitely is yet another reason to hate Billionaires as a group.

The pettiness of this creature is on full display. According to <a href="https://www.canadianbusiness.com/lists-and-rankings/richest-people/rich-100-aquilini-family/">Canadian Business</a>, the Aquilini family has a net worth of 3.3 billion dollars, making them the 27th wealthiest family in Canada. And this is how classy they are, rubbing it in to a fired employee. And what you should hear when you see this is Aquilini signalling to other members of the Donor Class how distant he is from the filthy Peasant Mark Donnelly, who doesn't understand that Black Lives Matter massings do not spread Covid, but Christmas does.

Donnelly is a fixture at home games for the Canucks, but his political views have also attracted controversy in the past.

In 2012, he sang the national anthem for an anti-abortion caravan as it passed through Vancouver.

In fact, Mark Donnelly is a great man. He's a father of 9 children, and an anti-abortion activist. At one point, he ran in essentially a primary for the Conservative Party seat in South Surrey-White Rock, which is exactly where I am from. Now, we hate the Conservative Party, but he's an outsider who's simply been hoodwinked into thinking the Donor-Right Party is ever going to do anything for the Peasants. That they're not, is not his fault, and he wasn't supported at all by their establishment.

I strongly doubt he was paid any money to sing the national anthem for the Anti-Abortion Caravan back in 2012, and I strongly doubt he was paid any money to sing the national anthem for the Anti-Covidtastrophism Rally that happened today.

And besides, he has a great voice.
