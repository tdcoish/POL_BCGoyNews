I checked Twitter today, and I saw that Vancouver was trending. When I clicked on that, I saw that there was this happening in Vancouver.

Yes, Andy Ngo is a fag. Yes, his entire schtick is "I went to some Antifa and they beat me up, sent me monero pay piggy." But he still does fairly good work. 

Anyway, I would like to make it very clear. This is Vancouver, Washington, not British Columbia. This was trending in Canada erroneously. Also, the top reply is fairly lit.

This is the quality of human that joins Antifa. Literal googly eyed manlets, who are shorter than the two women next to them. Also, LOL at their outfits. As others have said, these are some of the dumbest looking queers that I have ever seen. However, the Googly Eyed Manlet might be the most immediately funny of the bunch, but let's not underestimate this creature.

Nothing says "fear me," like having your prefered pronouns on your chest.
