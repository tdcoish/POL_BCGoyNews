Another story from early January, but I couldn't cover it then because of the horrible <a href="../Articles/GraphicsCardExplosion.html">Graphics Card Explosion of 2021.</a>

I wasn't sure the tweet would imbed properly, so here's a screenshot I took of the video. What you will see, if you are not a bigot, is a pack of 20 heroic Pension Seekers in Blue aggressively dragging a team of 6 Quebec Neo-Nazi's out of their own house for breaking arcane and capricious Covidtastrophism Lockdown rules. They had a grand total of 6 people on the premises. Basically super spreaders.

If you are a bigot you'll see a bunch of cops who need to be made examples of.
