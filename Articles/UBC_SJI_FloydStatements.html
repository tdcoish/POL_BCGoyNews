                <h2 id="date">November 20th, 2020</h2>

                <div class="articleContent">
<a href="../Articles/UBC_SJI_BlackOrganizations.html">Yesterday</a>, I showed you the list of "Black Organizations," that the UBC Social Justice Institute linked to, in their <a href="../Articles/UBCSJIGeorgeFloyd.html">SOCIAL JUSTICE INSTITUTE STATEMENT ON ANTI-BLACKNESS AND THE KILLING OF GEORGE FLOYD: BLACK LIVES MATTER</a>, and yes, that is capitalized here because they capitalized it there. Again, I have no idea why, it wasn't my decision.

Anyway, after seeing that the organizations themselves were Shaniqua Scams, and if you don't know what that means please read the first link, it's hilarious, I wanted to take a closer look at the mission statements themselves. So, let's bring up that image again, and start knocking this off, one by one.

<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRCoqNGjLC8k1Pbg-vYh6RoAOTtGxb8EYmw5H-Hn20NQhqVX7qBLFgt41BmWtAxrrKF4571VpcFj7gj/pub?fbclid=IwAR3WHmRqmzCx-iMa3gMC7niLOZuV0V-hB2EptXjnYlKuB_TYxy2SzPuBFcY">Black Lives Matter Vancouver.</a> I found that to be a particularly low energy organization, with a barely active twitter page, and not much else. Their mission statement is equally unserious. At the top of the page is a bizarre little text blurb that states "Updated automatically every 5 minutes." I know that doesn't have anything to do with anything, but it's just such a hilariously black mis-attention to detail that it cracks me up everytime I look to it over there. I mean it's a static page. It's a mission statement. It's not a goddamn sports ticker.

For many of you acknowledging—for the first time—that #blacklivesmatter, this  comes with a pang of guilt: a realisation of complacency and complicity in the face of ongoing state-sanctioned violence you thought was in the past. For others, this simple statement is an affirmation of our existence, and our deserving to live and thrive. Black Lives Matter Vancouver exists to hold police accountable for violence against Black people. We do so while standing in solidarity with the Indigenous people on the traditional, ancestral and unceded territory of the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), Sḵwx̱wú7mesh (Squamish), and Səl̓ílwətaʔ/Selilwitulh (Tsleil-Waututh) First Nations currently known as Vancouver.

I've noticed that these blacks, who I might add, and this will shock you, are not native to America, really try to play up this imaginary solidarity between them and the Abos. Hilariously the term "Buffalo Soldier," was created by Cheyenne Indians as a slur for the blacks. They called them Buffalos, because they have nappy hair. They also shit on them all the time and basically called them joke soldiers. The idea that there is this coalition to be found between Abos and Jequeerus is beyond stupid, it's laughable.

Now, before I get into this next part, I need to share this screenshot I took of this. I want you to pay close attention to the weird lack of space between the two paragraphs. I didn't want to include the whole doc, but other paragraphs have an actual space between them. This entire document feels like some Shaniqua being assigned a 6 paragraph essay, waiting until the night before, then having nobody proofread this for basic errors, like not having an actual space between paragraphs.

I swear to god, if this had been written by White People, I would have just assumed that my browser wasn't loading it correctly or something. But I guess it's like Narrative Collapse in a story, once you lose trust, you lose trust.

Cultural amnesia allows us to think that Canada’s, and British Columbia’s history sits atop a moral high ground, and many people assume that Canada is “not as bad” as the United States. Let it be known that a nation built upon stolen lands and enslavement can only do so under implicit threat of violence. Land dispossession and brutal violence are the underpinnings of our shared history within this particular police state. The punitive justice model employed by the VPD is harming our communities, and creates unsafe conditions because of increased police surveillance. We cannot move forward without a shift to community-based models of security and safety. A restorative justice model will allow good to come from harm, and stifle the cycle of pain, abuse, and racial violence at the root of policing.

Well first of all, black people do not have a "shared history," here in Canada. Blacks were less than 0.1% of the population before 1970. Secondly, there's the tried and true argument of "if we stole this land, what are you doing here?" Although honestly, if you think that Shaniqua arrived at her position through facts and logic and not just anti-white resentment, I don't know what to tell you. 

Everything else is just retarded shit that black people say. Police surveillance has a lot of problems, none of which is "creates unsafe conditions." I've railed against the cops before, <a href="../Articles/PSA_CopFinkelthink.html">trust me</a>, but the idea that increased police... you know what? Why the fuck am I using facts and logic in response to Shaniqua? I literally just pointed out how retarded this is.

We stand in solidarity with our people in the United States, but we will not allow Canadians to use the struggle of Black people to the south as a tool to distract from the ongoing police violence against, and state-sanctioned oppression of Black lives in Canada, British Columbia, and Vancouver. Simply put, the distinctions between the ways Black folks were used to generate wealth for the economies of colonial North America do not change the racist and white supremacist opinions and institutions that founded our two countries. The City of Vancouver has recently spoken up against anti-Black racism, but it was long overdue. It is imperative that the city acts in continuous collaboration with the Black community to address the long-standing institutional racism that exists within its policies and practices. We vehemently oppose the violence enacted on Black bodies by police, and the state, as well as the undergirding conditions which facilitate and justify this violence.

You don't need me to deconstruct this. Anyway, what they want is summed up at the bottom of the page. I was going to quote it, but it's just yet more dumb shit that's going nowhere. Somewhat interestingly, they do actually give you the emails of various city councillors and a few other positions, including the Vancouver Pride Society Board. They don't like the Vancouver Fetish Society Board, because they've been working closely with police for years for Fetish Pride, and didn't go along with the retarded, designed to go nowhere "defund the police," LARP.  
BLM is telling their followers to email those positions, but considering how poorly organized the whole thing is, it seems like something that just ends there. I guess you're supposed to send some angry emails off to these people and then hope they do what you want. Doesn't seem all too important.

Moving forwards, we have the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/UBCBSU/photos/a.579764568727310/3002029453167464/?type=3&theater">UBC Black Student Union</a>, or rather we have a link to an image from their Facebook Page, that I've pasted below. I don't think that black people have quite yet figured out what a "mission statement," really is. Maybe with a few thousand years of evolution, they'll figure it out.
<img src="../Images/ubcBSU_Facebook.png"><figcaption>Stunning and brave</figcaption>
You then have to navigate to their actual Facebook Page. I have no idea why I was sent to their Instagram Page in my previous article, because their Facebook Page appears to actually be actively updated, about two or three times a week, with the last update being just 6 hours ago, from when I write this on November 20th, 2020. The content of their page is fairly mediocre stuff, although I did see something that might be outright legally actionable.
<img src="../Images/ubcBSU_DiscriminatoryHiring.PNG"><figcaption>Shame we don't have any lawyers yet</figcaption>
They've also got only one like an almost every single post, more proof, in case you needed it, of them being an unpopular, astroturfed organization.

Next up is something more serious, the <a href="https://www.law.utoronto.ca/news/open-letter-black-law-students-association">Black Law Students Association</a>, statement. 
TDC_ARTICLE_START
Conversations about racial inequality and police brutality against Black people are currently dominating the media landscape. This has been prompted in part by the recent murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery. Amidst a global pandemic which has confined millions of people to their homes, these three Black people have nevertheless been murdered due to the prevalence of racism and white supremacy. These three are but an infinitesimal percent of the innumerable Black people who have been executed at the hands of a corrupt system that supports and sustains unchecked police brutality and mismanagement of justice. Tamir Rice, Sandra Bland, Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner. These are names that are part of our social consciousness as Black people existing within a racist system.

Honestly, I'm not going to quote any more of this. Wake me up when this shit is written by a Jew. This is really shit tier anti-whitism, and I don't appreciate my time being wasted. These people are not actual power players, they're the black version of useful idiots. These people can barely write a functional mission statement, these aren't exactly the movers and shakers here, just pawns. I haven't found the Schlomo yet, but I can feel it's presence. Lurking in the shadows, waiting.

Only one group left to go seems somewhat serious, and that would be the <a href="https://cis.arts.ubc.ca/announcements/cis-statement-on-anti-black-violence/">UBC Institute for Critical Indigenous Studies</a>
TDC_ARTICLE_START
The Institute for Critical Indigenous Studies stands in solidarity with Black people around the world in their calls for justice for George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, Regis Korchinski-Paquet, Tony McDade, and all Black people who have experienced historic, systemic and ongoing police violence/brutality.

We call for an end to violence towards Black people on stolen land.

We are living through a global pandemic that attacks the respiratory system, leaving many marginalized Black and Brown communities gasping for breath. According to the COVID Racial Data Tracker, Black people account for 13% of the US population yet 24% of COVID-related deaths where race was known. On top of that, Eric Garner, George Floyd, and countless other Black people have had their breath stolen from them by police, prisons, and a racist system, forcing people to take to the streets during a time where we’re all urged to stay home. Black communities are facing dual pandemics – structural racism is a public health crisis that has plagued communities for much longer than COVID-19 has.

Then again, just because it's more serious, doesn't mean this shit's not retarded. I mean how am I supposed to not laugh at COVID-19 leaving marginalized brown people "gasping for breath." Am I being too obvious by pointing out that White People are also left gasping for breath. It's a fucking respiratory illness. 

Part of the reason that I created this website is so that you can have someone filter this shit for you, if even just to have someone go "LOL," while reading transparently idiotic statements. I feel that I am here for your very sanity, goy.

And if too many D'Andre's are catching COVID, maybe they shouldn't be massing together to go loot the target? Just a thought. But I do have to keep going, because the end of this is quite funny.

The violence that we are seeing may not be new, but neither is resistance to it. The ongoing protests and direct action are an indictment of the current state of affairs, and the movement that we see all around us today will light our way towards anti-colonial futures based in healing, justice, and uncontroversial acknowledgements that Black lives matter. We hope that these calls for justice will be heard and transformation realized.

If you would like to show your support of these protests and families affected, here is a list of organizations that are accepting donations:
TDC_ARTICLE_STOP
Yep, another call for cat ladies money. They just can't get enough of this shit. And this is even a University of British Columbia Organization. 
<img src="../Images/CIS_DonateHerePayPiggy.PNG"><figcaption>Pay Piggy put Monero Here Pls</figcaption>
I recognize Unicorn Riot. That's an Antifa Organization. I believe the very same one that got Mike Enoch banned from twitter the first time, for too many anti-war tweets. I might be wrong there, I think that could have just been that weirdo "journalist," Mike Hayden, or whatever his name is. Anyway the others are retreads, or the same old.

So there you have it. I think I might go back over these statements, but the problem is that they are really just not worth getting into the weeds over. These are in many cases written by 90IQ Shaniqua's. Analyzing them is a sort of mental illness in and of itself. Or rather, once you've seen one, you've seen them all, therefore analyzing more than one is an exercise in mental illness. 

As far as our goals go, well first and foremost we need to understand what's happening in our province, and country. What we've learned is that these organizations are basically jokes. Sure, they've wormed their way into positions of power, and they must be removed, but they are also transparent grifters. What I mean by that is, these people are quite obviously not writing legislation, nor do they really have the upper echelons of power. This is good to know, but we would have predicted this after all.
