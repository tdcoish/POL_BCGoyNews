So the backstory here is that the Delta Hospice Society is trying to legally change itself into a Christian Group, so that it is not forced to provide "assisted suicide," which is basically murdering old people.

TDC_ARTICLE_START"This is a special interest group that is denying the rights of all Delta citizens," said [George] Harvie. "I want them to do the right thing and get out."TDC_ARTICLE_STOP
That's the same mayor who made the anti-white statements in the Kiran Sidhu "I just got hosed down by the re-incarnation of Adolf Hitler in a wig" case.

TDC_ARTICLE_STARTIn response, Health Minister Adrian Dix announced the province was withdrawing $1.5 million in hospice funding effective February 2021. TDC_ARTICLE_STOP
Here we see the coordinated effort by Globo Homo to destroy Christianity. Of course, it is very important to understand that attacks on Christians are implicitly racial attacks on white people.
TDC_ARTICLE_STARTThe letter also mentions the "growing anxiety" in the community over a speech DHS chair Angelina Ireland delivered entitled Forcing a Hospice to Kill at a Christian-right convention in Independence, Ohio, in March.
In the speech, Ireland introduces herself as "pro-life, pro-God and pro-gun," and refers to the Delta Hospice Society before her time on the board as the "Delta Auschwitz Society."TDC_ARTICLE_STOP
I hope Angelina isn't married because I may have just found my waifu. I have to be honest though, "Delta Auschwitz Society" is a bitchin name for a heavy metal band. "Opening for Slayer, we have Delta Auschwitz Society performing their new hit, 'Another lampshade for Valhalla'".
I looked her up, and it turns out that Angelina is a member of the PPC, and was in fact our candidate in Delta. Good girl.
TDC_ARTICLE_STARTIreland said the letter from the politicians was nothing more than attempt by the four to "cover their butts."
"They've done nothing to protect palliative care in the this province and that is why we're in the position," she said. "We just want to bring awareness to the fact that palliative care in this country is eroding, it's being destroyed and we have made a stand in defence of that."TDC_ARTICLE_STOP
Seems like a very interesting issue that I know very little about. Gonna have to get this girl on the show. 
TDC_ARTICLE_STARTInDelta resident Brian McKenna had his membership application denied and wrote a letter that was published in the Delta Optimist under the title: Delta Hospice hits new low by trying to impose religion on the dying.
McKenna says not only is the society stacking the deck for the upcoming vote, he believes the end game of the board is a challenge under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
"It seems painfully obvious what's going to happen," said McKenna. "They'll try and pretend that this is a religious organization, impose a religious creed on it and then claim religious protection under the charter to try to thwart what Minister Dix is attempting to do."
McKenna, a retired military veteran, says although he believes the actions of Ireland and the board are "abhorrent," they deserve credit for being organized. 
"I'll give them credit. They have a plan and the people opposing them don't," he said.TDC_ARTICLE_STOP
This sounds like these people losing. I have to say, I really like what I'm seeing here. 
TDC_ARTICLE_STARTIn[Delta mayor George] Harvie says the board's actions are damaging the operation and good reputation of a beloved community facility.
"What does it say to all of Delta, the people who over the years fought hard to ensure that we had a hospice for continuous care," he said.
"It's a wonderful facility ... and they have absolutely ruined it."TDC_ARTICLE_STOP

Alright who elected this asshole? This is literally about murdering old people, not "continuous care." It is literally the opposite of "continuous care," and I highly doubt that the good people of the Delta Hospice Society have "absolutely ruined it." This guy...
