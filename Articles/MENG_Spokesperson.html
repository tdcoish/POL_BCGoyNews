For those of you who need a refresher in what's going on in the Meng Wanzhou trial, and how much of a disgusting joke it is, <a href="MengWanzhouArrest.html">here</a> is a brief overview on the situation, and <a href="VanMountieSuggestArrestMengWanzhou.html">here</a> is a much longer article, actually the longest I ever wrote, on her sham trial. To briefly summarize from both of those articles. First, the overview.
TDC_ARTICLE_START
So this is basically the shot. This is our government, on behalf of Zionist Jews who hate all the goyim, and Tech Conglomerates who look down on the filthy peasants, arresting an important Chinese Official. And yes, you, the Canadian Goy-Peasant, get absolutely zero benefit out of this. And no, the government will still happily send your job over seas, including to China. And yes, this very same government will happily import Chinese People into your neighbourhood and then lecture you on your "xenophobia." And no, this government won't do anything about the massive censorship these Conglomerates do to us despite using the government infrastructure that we built. And yes, these Conglomerates will happily hire legions of foreigners over a single native born White Canadian/American.

Secondly, if you want a summary of how cartoonish and stupid her arrest was.
TDC_ARTICLE_START
1) RCMP officers pretended Meng Wanzhou had zero ties in Canada, despite owning two homes, and having Permanent Residency Status.

2) Someone between the RCMP and CSBA pretended that a 50 year old Asian lady, by herself, required a huge security team to arrest. This was clearly done as a show, to humiliate Meng Wanzhou, for political reasons.

3) Adding on to that, the utter absurdity of pretending they needed to go onto the plane, because this Asian Lady was really fast or something, or maybe she was going to hoodini her way off the side of the plane or something retarded, is so beyond stupid that it can only be argued in bad faith. They ultimately decided the optics were too bad, but that this was even considered shows that this was done to humiliate Meng, and the Chinese more broadly.

4) There was no reason for the CBSA investigation to happen before the RCMP investigation. Or rather, no valid reason. Instead, this was done to fish out as much information as possible, with Meng not having a lawyer.

5) Even more importantly, the CBSA had the authority to, without a warrant, confiscate materials such as Meng's laptop, phone, and phone passcodes. The RCMP does not legally have the authority to obtain those materials.

6) The CBSA then pulled the world's least believable "whoopsie," and "accidentally," gave information the RCMP would not legally be able to obtain, such as phone passcodes, to the RCMP. As well as the two phones, the laptop, and the tablet.

7) Nobody in the CBSA was disciplined in any way for this.

8) The RCMP "didn't think anything of it," when presented with materials, data and information that they would not be legally allowed to obtain.

9) The RCMP then refused to give back any of Meng's belongings, using the baffling excuse that doing so would provide a "lack of transparency," despite objectively doing the opposite. They then logged her passcodes because "they had already been siezed," despite this being illegal for the RCMP to obtain.

10) Multiple RCMP officers and CBSA officers have strenuosly denied any contact with the FBI, but we have emails of them talking with FBI agents.

So that's what's going on and why. The usual suspects are at it again with another whine-fest.
<a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/7637203/huawei-canada-meng-wanzhou-two-michaels/">Global News:</a>
TDC_ARTICLE_START
Huawei Canada’s vice-president of government relations repeatedly would not condemn the arbitrary detention by China of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, despite specifically and repeatedly insisting the company’s CFO Meng Wanzhou has “done nothing wrong.”
TDC_ARTICLE_STOP
That sentence... doesn't make any sense. What do the two have to do with each other? It's like a really shit-tier attempt at conflating the two. Meng Wanzhou absolutely did nothing wrong, and the two faggots Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor are agent provocateur's sent by Globo Homo to fuck up China.

The below is from an interview with The West Block‘s Mercedes Stephenson.

“I think we’re all frustrated with the lack of communications between the government, between governments on a number of issues,” he said. “The company has never done anything wrong. We’ve been transparent in all our interactions. Meng Wanzhou has done nothing wrong.“

“I’m going to stop you there because I think that’s interesting,” Stephenson said. “Your company’s position is — and as the Canadian version of Huawei — is that Meng Wanzhou has done nothing wrong. So you don’t think that the RCMP arrest of her was legitimate?”

“The company has done nothing wrong, Meng Wanzhou has done nothing wrong,” Elliott said, adding that the previous U.S. administration used “companies and, unfortunately, people as political pawns.”

I mean it's obvious of course, especially when you see how hilariously fake the arrest of Meng Wanzhou was in the first place. Still, I feel much of my job is simply to be out there speaking obvious truths, because honesty is a deep offense to Globo Homo Schlomo. But yes, this is entirely fake and political.
TDC_ARTICLE_START
Canadian authorities arrested Meng in December 2018 at the behest of American law enforcement, who charged her and her company shortly afterwards with dozens of criminal charges related to allegations of skirting sanctions on Iran and stealing corporate secrets.
TDC_ARTICLE_STOP
It's important to do sanctions on Iran, because Jew Supremacists who refer to you as subhuman goy-cattle hate that a strong Iran gets in the way of them genociding every goy in the region.

China, in contrast, does not have an independent judiciary and has laid out no evidence or clear details of the allegations against Kovrig and Spavor, other than to charge them with the vague accusations of spying and sharing state secrets.

The country’s court system is controlled by its ruling Chinese Communist Party.

It has a conviction rate of approximately 99 per cent.
TDC_ARTICLE_STOP
<img src="../Images/memeLaughDiCaprio.jpg">
Oh man, this is so ridiculous that it's funny. 99% conviction rate == bad. 100% conviction rate of "Human Rights Tribunals" here in Canada == good. 

Also, LOL, just LOL at "muh independent judiciary." I mean it's not even worth responding to.

Finally, you should 100% either not care or just laugh at the Michael's getting fucked over by the Communist Party of China. Those faggots would laugh if the FBI or RCMP gay-op'd you and sent you to prison for 419 years for defending yourself against antifa. So fuck them and chuckle.

As far as the rest of this propaganda piece goes, you've gotten the gist of it already, but I'm going to reprint some choice bits, because it's "CHINA IS ASSHOLE" tier propaganda.

“As a Canadian, though, are you comfortable with calling the detention of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor political and it’s just pointing fingers?” Stephenson asked. “They were arbitrarily detained. So I guess I’ll put it to you right now. Will you call for their release? Will Huawei Canada call for their release?”
...
“That doesn’t answer the question of whether Huawei Canada will condemn the detention of the two Michaels,” said Stephenson. “If Huawei wants to do business and you’re speaking as a Canadian, why would the company be unwilling to condemn the treatment of those two Canadian citizens?”

“Well as a company, we want everyone home, we want to send Meng Wanzhou back to China,” he said.

“So you see the detention of Meng Wanzhou and the two Michaels, you see those as equal? You see those as morally equal?” Stephenson interjected.

“This was actions that were outside of the company,” Elliott said. “We’re not a political entity, we’re not a political government. We’re a tech company that wants to do business in Canada. We want everyone home.”
...
Elliott was asked why — if the company will not condemn the arbitrary detention of two Canadians by China — should Canadians trust the company’s assertion that it would defy the Chinese state if ordered to use their technology to spy on Canadians, which Chinese laws require.
...
However, both the U.S. and Australia have functioning independent judiciaries as well as freedom of speech laws that allow their citizens to both criticize and vote out governments they feel to be encroaching on their constitutional rights.

The citizens of both countries also have constitutional rights, which domestic courts have cited in rolling back and limiting provisions in American national security laws, for example.

OMFG LOL. Censorship advocates doing the whole "muh free speech, muh fair elections," routine.
TDC_ARTICLE_START
The Chinese government routinely detains human rights activists and critics of the regime on accusations of subversion, and does not allow free expression or free and fair elections.

Lawyers representing pro-democracy protesters who were arrested under China’s national security law banning criticism of the government have recently had their licences stripped.

“With respect to 3G, 4G, and LTE networks, CSE has clearly stated that we have been able to mitigate cyber security risks through a collaborative risk mitigation framework,” said CSE spokesperson Evan Koronewski, pointing to the CSE’s 2018 public statement. 

“Regarding the 5G security review, CSE has not commented publicly on 5G security, except to maintain that we continue to work with relevant Government of Canada departments and agencies,” he continued.
...
Elliott was also asked about concerns raised last week by CSIS director David Vigneault in a rare public speech that China is looking to silence minorities and critics, including those based abroad.
