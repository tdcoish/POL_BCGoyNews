<a href="../Articles/UBCSocialJusticeInstitutePart1.html">Background on the UBC Social Justice Institute.</a> This is a series I'm doing on their LOLcow faculty. I skipped over two boring people and got to John Paul Catungal.

We are literally one sentence in and I am already amused and moderately discombobulated.
TDC_ARTICLE_START
His research interests concern Filipinx and Asian Canadian studies; feminist and queer of colour critique; migrant, anti-racist and queer community organizing; and the politics of education, mentorship, teaching and learning.

He seems like quite the prize "Filipinx". I'm not going to get snippets until the end, because it's this guys entire bio.
TDC_ARTICLE_START
JP is currently Assistant Professor in Critical Racial and Ethnic Studies with UBC’s Social Justice Institute. His active research projects include “Mentorship as Political Practice”, a community partnered research project with the Kababayan Academic Mentorship Program (KAMP); “Queer World Cities”, in partnership with Dr. Natalie Oswin (at McGill University); and an oral history of HIV/AIDS in Vancouver BC, with various local community partners. He teaches courses on theories of subjectivity, representation and queer of colour critique, as well as global social justice issues and Asian Canadian studies.

I bet AIDS has quite the oral history in downtown Vancouver. It's got an oral history on Robson, and an anal history in Chinatown.
TDC_ARTICLE_START
JP was co-editor of the landmark 2012 volume Filipinos in Canada: Disturbing Invisibility (University of Toronto Press), as well as of recent journal special issues on the intersections of sexuality, race and nation in the Canadian context in ACME: International Journal of Critical Geographies and TOPIA: Canadian Journal of Cultural Studies. He has been co-editor of ACME: International Journal of Critical Geographies since August 2017. Since coming to UBC, JP has also been active in media-based public pedagogy through expert interviews and writing on local and national issues concerning sexuality, LGBTQ issues, immigration and racism. He also holds faculty affiliations with Asian Canadian and Asian Migration Studies and the Department of Geography.

TL:DR:
1) "interdisciplinary scholar trained in the nexus of critical human geography and intersectional feminist theorizing."
2) "Filipinx and Asian Canadian studies"
3) "queer of colour critique"
4) "an oral history of HIV/AIDS"

Definitely adding some of these to the growing list.
