                    NOTE: This story is originally from July, but I am reposting it here.

                    Don't bother reading enemy propaganda.
                    A few days ago in Coquitlam an old woman, Andrea Tylczak, got into an altercation with two Persian teenagers when picking berries. The teens had been, by their own admission, breaking the branches off of raspberry bushes because they were too lazy to pick the berries before walking. Breaking branches is of course against by-laws, because it destroys the bush for latter years and hikers, but the two Persian Princesses didn't seem to care about that.
                    The video that they have starts in the middle of the dispute, with Andrea stating quite politely that they shouldn't damage the bushes before walking away. The video is then edited, and when we come back, we see a much more heated exchange. At this point the girls start taunting Andrea by telling her, saying something that is cut out, and probably quite rude, before saying "why don't you mind your own business". At this point Andrea walks back and retorts with "you know that is the rudest thing you have said to me," a line that clearly indicates that much of this conversation has been cut out. Then Andrea says, "go back where you came from if you want to do something like that," at which point the Persian Princesses say, "oh why don't you go back from where you came from you fucking colonizer." 
                    Of course, calling a white woman a colonizer is a clear racial slur. There is no other reason to call her that, other than as a racial attack. Luckily I did some research, and figured out who one of the girls are, beyond the name given in the article of Elika Gholizadeh. She is, or at least was, a hostess at Earls Port Coquitlam, and has lived in Coquitlam her entire life, all found from her irregularly updated facebook page. I can only speculate who the other girl in the story was. 
                    The article is written by Ben Miljure, of CTV BC, and curiously, does not mention the anti-white slur directed at the white woman. This serves the overall anti-white, and especially anti-white women attack that we have seen throughout the media. I may be preaching to the choir here, but CTV is nothing more than a propaganda outlet, created to push the message of its owners. 
                    UPDATE:
                    
                    I took the liberty of calling in to CTV at the time. <a href="https://www.bitchute.com/video/LBjYm45UIXhI/">Here’s a video of that call.</a> It was my first time doing a call like this, so it didn’t go perfectly.
                    And <a href="https://www.bitchute.com/video/XbpbahANeRPH/">here’s</a> the followup video.

                    I did at least get them to admit on record that they refuse to release un-edited videos, which is obviously because they're liars.
                    
                    Here's a picture of Elika Gholizadeh.

                    She used to work at an Earls as a hostess, and I believe she is currently a student at SFU.

                    Here's Ben Miljure, the main propagandist on this story.

                    I cover tranny issues a lot, so I've seen a lot of really unsettling faces, and this is far from the worst. Still, I have to say, his is definitely off-putting.
