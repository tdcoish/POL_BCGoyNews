According to Blacklock’s Reporter, the CBC will get a 9.8% increase in funding for 2020, alongside an additional $33,733,999 grant.

Since the first quarter of 2019, ad revenue has declined by nearly $10 million. In 2020, the CBC reported $38.5 million in ad revenue, while a year prior they were able to net $48.2 million.

Even before the pandemic, the CBC has struggled with profitability and abysmal viewership percentages.

In 2019, only 0.8% of Canadians tuned in to watch CBC news’ evening broadcasts. 

Meanwhile, annual earnings fell by 37% when compared to the previous year.

Honestly even I'm surprised at how irrelevant the CBC is making itself. This article actually downstates how dire the financial situation for the CBC is. Back in 2014, they had advertising revenues of $192 million per year. This has fallen every single year until now.<a href="../Articles/CBC_FallingAdRevenue.html"> I wrote an article on that.</a> 

But a viewership of 0.8% of Canadians. Even I didn't expect that. Oh and keep in mind that the CBC already gets 1.2 billion in your taxes every year already. This is just them getting even more.

“Our objective is not to make money but to provide a service and fulfil our mandate. We reinvent ourselves every year to try and find new ways to do things because we have to offer more, but with a smaller budget. So that requires visionary talent,” said Radio-Canada Executive Vice President Michel Bissonnette.

I don't want to sound like a broken record but this guy and his face give me the creeps. I've been putting off taking a look at him in a video because I'm not sure I'm prepared for how offputting he's going to be in motion and sound.

And LOL at the CBC having "visionary talent," like just fucking LOL. Go <a href="../Articles/CBC_CreativeReliefFund.html">take a look</a> at the "visionary talent" they got with their "Covid Creative Relief," fund. Here's a sample for you.

I was going to include more, but that really sums it up goyim.

“As a result of some necessary changes with respect to resizing our business, a number of positions from within the organization will no longer be a part of our workforce come the end of the calendar year,” wrote CBC executive vice-president Barbara Williams to staff.

Wouldn't it be really hilarious to get all these propagandists naked and afraid up on a stage. Then have them scream at the top of their lungs "THERE ARE WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION IN IRAQ," over and over again while the peasants laugh and throw rotten fruit at them. And then, one by one, they get opiates shoved down their throats, and the others get to watch in growing horror as their propagandist colleague convulses and dies while foaming at the mouth. 

And all the while they beg for forgiveness that never comes.
