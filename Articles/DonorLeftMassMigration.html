Prime Minister Justin Trudeau may struggle to sell his ambitious new immigration plan to Canadians, a new survey shows. 

Only 17% of respondents say the country should accept more immigrants in 2021 than it did last year, according to a Nanos Research Group poll conducted for Bloomberg News. That suggests most Canadians are less than enthusiastic about aggressive new targets announced last week. 

Trudeau hopes to attract 401,000 newcomers next year, 60,000 more than in 2019. The target would rise by 10,000 in each subsequent year, bringing it to 421,000 in 2023. Respondents were asked whether the government should raise levels above last year’s actual inflows.

First of all, “ambitious,” that’s an interesting term to use. Ambitious from what degree, destroying the nation fastest? Destroying social cohesion quicker? Destroying the wages of Canadians ASAP? On what grounds is this an ambitious plan?

I guess from Michael Bloombergs perspective.

An open-door policy is a central tenet of the Liberal government’s long-term growth agenda. But with the economy recovering from the damage wrought by Covid-19, opposition parties are raising concern. “We’re facing 9% to 10% unemployment -- more than a million Canadians are out of work,” Conservative lawmaker Raquel Dancho said in an interview, adding that affordable housing is also scarce. “Where are these folks going to work? Where are these folks going to live?” Closed borders and pandemic-related travel restrictions have slowed immigration this year and the country is on pace to meet only 60% of its 2020 target of 341,000 permanent residents.

Good question Raquel. Notice she uses the term “folks,” and not “foreign parasites.” And yes, language does matter. LOL if you think the Donor-Right party is going to do jack shit to stop this, in the year 2020.

Here’s a picture of Rock Ribbed Conservative Raquel Dancho celebrating Pride month. That’s from a video “On behalf of the Conservative Caucus,” BTW, where lots of other Donor-Right Puppets are present.

The survey results suggest Trudeau’s new targets don’t enjoy widespread support. Some 40% of respondents say the government should reduce the number of new permanent residents accepted in 2021 below 340,000. And 36% say they would like the country to maintain the same immigration levels as 2019.

Immigration Minister Marco Mendicino argues increasing the number of permanent residents will support the economy’s recovery from Covid-19 and help fill vacancies in essential work like healthcare. He is also hoping to draw on the more than 1 million foreign students, temporary workers and asylum seekers already in the country to achieve the increased targets. 

“Canadians have a long, proud history of welcoming immigrants, because we know immigration makes our country stronger,” Mendicino said Friday by email, citing support for the higher targets from business and unions.

I’d like to point out that those numbers are extremely fragile. Give Canadians an option for zero migration and you’ll quickly find that’s the most popular option. 

But don’t you just love being lectured on what it means to be Canadian by parasites who just flew in from Paris a day earlier. One minute in Prague, one minute in Brussels, the next in Canada, telling you what it means to be Canadian.

But even more hilarious is the idea that unions would support higher migration numbers. I mean it’s plausible that the union employees would, they’re a bunch of privileged university degree holding upper middle class faggots. Let’s go ask the actual peasants who are the unionized, and ask them how much they enjoy paying dues to a labour union that does worse than nothing for them.

And as far as business interests are concerned, well of course. Migration destroys wages, so billionaires love it. As far as I’m concerned an endorsement from business interests is like an endorsement from the CBC, proof of the malicious intent.

From the study here: 
TDC_ARTICLE_START “The regression of low-skilled workers indicates that for each one percent increase in the immigrant composition of a low-skilled worker’s occupation, hourly wages fell by -.63 percent.”TDC_ARTICLE_STOP

That’s a study from 1998, recent findings have found an even larger decrease in wages from migrants.

Anyway, back to Bloomberg.

The flow of newcomers into Canada has been credited with helping counter aging demographics and supporting everything from the housing market to banking services. Before Covid-19, the government’s policies helped drive the fastest pace of population growth in three decades.

Translation: Migrants price you out of your home. Migrants are good for financial parasites. This gets reframed as them “supporting,” these things, as if that’s good for you.

It’s the same trick they pull when (((Economists))) point out that migrants increase the efficiency of labour markets. When you actually translate that into English, what that means is they lower wages. Since same work for less wages == more efficient, therefore they increase efficiency. They use the term “efficiency,” instead of lower wages, because they want you to think of this as some sort of economic progress, such as how the invention of the shovel makes workers more efficient at digging ditches.

Dancho, the chief Conservative spokeswoman on the issue, said her party is pro-immigration but thinks the Liberal government’s announcement of new targets was “tone deaf” as “it did not acknowledge the feasibility concerns of bringing in this many new workers.” 

The Nanos survey of 1,000 Canadians was conducted between Oct. 28 and Nov. 1 via telephone and online. The government announced the new targets Oct. 30.

Holy shit I am so fucking pumped for Donor-Right Narratives. Fuck yeah, let’s drown Canadians in Foreigners slightly less fast. Are you fucking ready? Get excited about new Donor-Right Talking Point. Ever so slightly less migrants, maybe, although they’re not committing to any hard numbers, and are “pro-immigration.”

I’ve said before, and I’ll say again, there are no actual arguments for mass migration. There are really no arguments for small amounts of migration. The only genuine arguments for a tiny amount of 140+ IQ immigrants who we need for actual specific jobs with skills that it is unrealistic to expect the education system to be able to provide. And this would be about 100 people per year. 

Instead, we get our beautiful country flooded with these parasites. And make no mistake, Donor-Right supports this completely.
