TDC_ARTICLE_START
The B.C. Human Rights Tribunal has made it clear that anyone thinking of filing a complaint because they were told to wear a mask in a store will actually have to prove they have a disability that prevents them from doing so.

In a screening decision handed down Wednesday, tribunal member Steven Adamson wrote that "a large volume of complaints" have been filed over B.C.'s COVID-19 measures requiring face coverings in public indoor spaces like grocery stores, libraries and community centres.

The tribunal normally doesn't publicize this type of decision, which determines if a complaint contains a possible violation of the B.C. Human Rights Code. But Adamson said he wanted to publish one anonymized example for the purpose of public education.

I couldn't find a picture of Steven Adamson, so I put this up there instead. It doesn't really matter, what's important is that the so called "Human Rights Tribunals," have somehow managed to have an unbroken streak of victories against justice yet again.

Being anti-mask, without pointing out that the borders are wide open, or that BLM chimpouts are allowed to go on in the middle of a pandemic. But the point of Servatism is to be retarded, and snatch defeat from the jaws of victory every time. "Shut the borders, or shut your mouth," should be the slogan here, but instead we get this whiny LOLbertarian "muh freedoms," shit instead.
