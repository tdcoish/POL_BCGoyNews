OTTAWA — A second video of Jagmeet Singh has surfaced showing the NDP leader speaking on a panel focused on Sikh sovereignty, alongside another speaker who appears to endorse violence in the quest for an independent Sikh state.

The video has come to light as Singh condemns “all acts of terrorism” in the wake of a news report about his presence at a Sikh rally in 2015 that featured calls for an independent state.

Wow, imagine my shock at finding out that the guy who <a href="../Articles/ProudBoysTerroristList.html">started the successful call for the Proud Boys</a> to be declared a terrorist group, and denounces "muh hate," "muh bigotry," has ties to actual Sikh Nationalist Terrorists, and has been seen at Sikh Nationalist rallies where they call for their independent state? 
Shock level: unspeakable.
But remember Whitey, when these people denounce White Nationalism, and "White Supreeeemacy," these are good faith arguments that you should take very seriously.

On Wednesday, the Globe and Mail published a story about Singh’s presence at a San Francisco rally where some speakers called for the creation of an independent state, known as Khalistan, in the Punjab region of India. Singh, then an NDP member of the Ontario legislature, spoke about the killing of Sikhs in India in 1984 following the assassination of then-prime minister Indira Gandhi, calling it a genocide.

The question of Singh’s position on Sikh separatism has dogged him since he appeared on CBC’s Power and Politics with Terry Milewski shortly after winning the federal leadership last October. During the interview, Singh failed to denounce Talwinder Singh Parmar, believed to be the mastermind of the 1985 Air India bombing.

Since then, Singh has walked a fine line on the question of sovereignty, at once advocating self-determination while condemning violence.

Read that last sentence again. Understand that's how this propagandist describes Sikh Nationalism. Let me rewrite that with White Nationalism.

Now ask yourself, are you ever gonna get propaganda like that, from the (((National Post)))?
