                    The above is a three minute video from the Vancouver Sun. It was released on July 1st, and has 1,556 views, 9 likes, and 15 dislikes. The video is largely an interview, bordering on puff piece, for an anti-white named Lama Mugabo. In the video he is whining about VPD Police Chief Palmer who claimed that there was no "systemic racism in the Vancouver Police Department." Mugabo whines about this for a while, before demanding "more representation on police boards, and adding black history in BC to education curriculums."

                    To make a long story short, this is just an anti-white activist, who wants white people to be racially discriminated against. Interestingly, at around the 1:15 in the video he claims, 
                    TDC_ARTICLE_START "this very place where we stand, we were displaced in 1972 when they built the viaducts. For us, these viaducts constitute a monument for our displacement, because when they brought the bulldozers, and people moved away, we lost our core, we lost our foundation. So when you are a black person and you come to Vancouver, you ask where do black people live, there is no place, we are all over the place. And so, for me, systemic racism is part of our lives here, and I think with recent incidents such as the public lynching of George Floyd in Minneapolis, and how major cities across the US, across Canada, in fact around the world, what that is telling us is that we've reached a tipping point, where people will no longer accept cosmetic change, we want radical changes. And so, we're starting with police, but I think it's important to look at education, health, housing, and all those other challenges that people of colour have had to face in our existence, trying to make Vancouver a livable city."
                    TDC_ARTICLE_STOP I'll leave it to the reader to take apart those statements. I'm more interested in actual action against these people. So who is Lama Mugabe? Well his LinkedIn profile shows that he is a member of the "Carnegie Community Action Project." So what is the CCAP? Well according to it's <a href="http://www.carnegieaction.org/">website:</a>
                    UPDATE: LOL his website doesn't even work anymore. These people are clowns.
                    TDC_ARTICLE_START The Carnegie Community Action Project (CCAP) works to increase welfare rates, improve social housing, and slow gentrification in Vancouverâ€™s Downtown Eastside (DTES). CCAP supports DTES residents to speak out for the changes we would like to see in the neighbourhood. CCAP works with english speaking and Chinese speaking DTES residents in speaking out on their own behalf for the changes they would like to see in their neighbourhood.
                    TDC_ARTICLE_STOP I've never heard any group actually explicitly trying to increase welfare rates, but this is basically just coded language for a bunch of blacks trying to stop Whitey from moving into "their" neighbourhood. Remember, Mugabe is on record explicitly saying that he wants spaces specifically for Black People. Regardless, the CCAP is basically a joke. When I clicked their twitter link, I get a page not found. When I click their facebook link, I get a page not found, when I go to carnegieaction.org, I get a "that site cannot be reached." As far as I can tell, this project exists on Mugabe's linkedIn page, and has a little blurb on change.org. Guy seems quite lazy and unproductive.

                    I'm trying to find out how this guy gets money, and the rest of his LinkedIn page follows a similar story of sounding impressive until researched. He's been a "Community Economic Development Term Instructor" for Nicola Valley Institute of Technology. That sounds somewhat impressive, except that NVIT is just an "Aboriginal governed post-secondary institute ,promotes First Nations traditional ways and fosters student success." I suppose it's possible that he's getting a regular paycheck from them, but there's a reason I've never heard of them. 
                    The guy also has done some "Building Bridges," work in Rwanda. A few jobs like that. Honestly, the more I look, the less I think this guy is worth our time.
