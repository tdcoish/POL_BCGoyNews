TDC_ARTICLE_STARTThe NDP will form a historic majority government in British Columbia for the first time in more than 20 years, CBC News projects, as voters opted to stay the course in a tumultuous year and send Leader John Horgan back to the legislature as the only consecutive two-term premier in his party's history. 
Horgan and the party are projected to take 55 of B.C.'s 87 ridings as of 11:30 p.m PT on Saturday, compared to 29 for the Liberals and three for the Green Party.
It will be the first NDP majority since 1996.
Just 50 seats would constitute a decisive victory in any B.C. election, as it only takes 44 to form government. Fifty-five seats for the NDP would break the previous party record of 51 seats in 1991.
Horgan, Liberal Leader Andrew Wilkinson and Green Party Leader Sonia Furstenau are all projected to hold their seats in Langford-Juan de Fuca, Vancouver-Quilchena and Cowichan Valley, respectively.
Successful gamble
The projected results show the gamble of calling an election in the middle of a pandemic paid off handsomely for Horgan, who enjoyed a high personal approval rating before the election and stayed comfortably high in the polls throughout the campaign.
"This has been an extraordinarily difficult election for many, many reasons, but it's one that I believe had to happen and I'm grateful for all British Columbians that we can put the election behind us and we can get back to focusing on the things that matter."
In contrast, it was a bleak night for the B.C. Liberals and Greens. Both parties had hoped Horgan's snap election risk would backfire and create the opportunity for a legislative takeover after 3½ years of a minority NDP government.
Twenty-nine seats is a major blow to the Liberals, which held 41 seats at dissolution. The poor performance will bring Wilkinson's future as party leader into question, as any loss of seats would have been considered a rebuke of his leadership and defeat for the party.
Wilkinson addressed constituents and the media at 10:15 p.m. PT. He acknowledged the NDP were "clearly ahead" based on preliminary results, but did not concede, saying the race isn't over until the mail-in ballot count.
"We'll have more to say going forward but for now we all have a responsibility to be patient, to respect the democratic process and to await the final results," he said before leaving the stage at his campaign headquarters.

Okay, I just have to interject. Wilkinson is such a low energy faggot that it blows my mind. I understand that the pool of people willing to be complete and utter whores for their donors is fairly small, so sometimes you don’t get the absolute best, but this guy is such a worthless faggot that I can’t help but think that there could have been someone, almost anyone better.

During her own speech, Sonia Furstenau — who became Green Party leader just seven days before the election was called — focused on how the sitting Greens will work in the legislature. The party is projected to maintain its three-seat count from 2017 on Saturday night, losing Oak Bay-Gordon Head but gaining its first on the B.C. mainland, with Jeremy Valeriote expected to defeat the Liberals in West Vancouver-Sea to Sky.
"The NDP engineered this election to get a majority and wipe out their opponents. They were half successful ... while they may have their majority, British Columbians have returned Green MLAs to hold government accountable — and there are still many votes to be counted."
The difference-maker for the NDP during the election was flipping ridings from old Liberal strongholds, including those in which the NDP has rarely been competitive — such as the ridings of Chilliwack and Langley in the province's Fraser Valley, which have been staunchly Liberal for years.
As of 11:30 p.m. PT, nine ridings are too close to call definitively with mail-in ballots still to be counted. Historically, though, mail-in ballots rarely deviate from the trends observed on election night in a way that would significantly impact a riding's projected outcome.

TDC_ARTICLE_STOP

Yes, this merits investigation. How exactly did the NDP get Langley and other areas that typically want nothing to do with the NDP. Immigration is probably a huge one, but I think more importantly we have just the Liberals finally being seen as the hated shills that they are. BC Elections estimated that the turnout was down to just 52% of “registered voters,” down from 61% in 2017. I’ll have an entire article written about that aspect of this, exploring this from all angles.

As far as the Liberals go, not a single person that I talked to gave a single fuck about these clowns. Nobody cares, nor should anybody care. They were and are seen as transparent shills, to the point that people are even paying attention. As the drastically lowered number of voters would show, people tuned out this donor fight altogether.

The campaign was unlike any other in the province's history, with the aim of choosing who will lead the population through its next wave of COVID-19 and, eventually, its recovery.
More than a million of B.C.'s 3.5 million registered voters cast their ballots in advance or by mail-in ballot before general voting day. 
"Never before have so many voters voted before election day in British Columbia electoral history," Elections BC's chief electoral officer Anton Boegman told reporters on Friday.
TDC_ARTICLE_STOP

Lol. Pretty transparent way of spinning horribly low turnout into something else. “Highest number of voters in this narrow category,” is not particularly legitimizing for the incoming regime.

Furstenau cast her ballot early Saturday at a community centre in the Vancouver Island community of Shawnigan Lake. Wilkinson voted at a Greek community centre in Vancouver's Shaughnessy neighbourhood.
Horgan was among just over 681,000 people who cast their ballots during the week-long advance voting period this past week, voting Monday at Luxton Hall in Langford, B.C.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau issued a statement congratulating Horgan and the NDP on behalf of the federal government at 10:30 p.m. PT.
"I look forward to continuing to work closely with Premier Horgan and the Government of British Columbia, so we can keep Canadians safe and healthy and offer support to those who need it, as we address the impacts of the global pandemic."
Horgan called the snap election on Sept. 21, citing a need for stability and certainty in the legislature during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The pandemic-era election — the first to be held in B.C. during a provincial state of emergency since the Second World War — saw its battles waged mostly online. Rallies were replaced by virtual debates and townhalls, hand-shaking by distant waving and smiles by cloth masks.
Adrian Dix, who helped lead B.C. through the first nine months of the pandemic as provincial health minister, was projected to hold his seat in Vancouver Kingsway.
At dissolution, the NDP and Liberals were tied with 41 seats in the legislature, while the Greens held two seats. Two seats were held by Independents and one seat was empty.
The NDP campaign was often more defensive than offensive, striking a stay-the-course tone with policy re-announcements and the hope of capitalizing on a widely acclaimed public health response to COVID-19.
The party platform was largely built on the party's record and promises to continue what it started, including expanding $10-a-day child care and implementing a rent freeze until the end of next year. There was also a promise to provide a $1,000 recovery benefit for families with annual household incomes under $125,000.

Okay, for those not familiar with BC Politics basically we have the NDP party, Globo HOMO, then we have the Green Party, Globo Homo, then we have the Liberal Party, GLOBO Homo. These parties are all the same, and none of this matters. However, historically the Liberals have had the most electoral power, so this is somewhat new but not unprecedented for the NDP to win a clear majority. Last election they had to form a coalition with the Greens to get that majority, which both parties didn’t like. I guess it’s the tyranny of small differences.
As far as the specific platforms, as you can see, nothing of importance is being talked about. BC has a massively unpopular school curriculum, which I wrote about on the old PPBC website, and will be writing about here as well, but that’s not on the ballot. We have an HIV positive homosexual in the Ministry of Children and Family Development who, by his own admission, diagnoses 10-20% of all the LITERALLY ORPHANED children as young as 2 years old in his care as being “gender dysphoric,” and thus “requiring,” sterilizing hormones from the age of 13 onwards. But that’s not on the ballot. We have massive racial discrimination against white people in university admissions, and elsewhere, but that’s not on the ballot. We have a massive censorship regime brought in by Zionist Jews, but that’s not on the ballot. Fuck, even the massive speculation on our real estate by foreign billionaires, not on the ballot. The tearing down of white statues, not on the ballot. The massive deaths from opiates, which have outpaced Covid deaths 3:1, not on the ballot. 
About the closest the Liberals ever got to a moderately good issue was when Wilkinson talked about people in Vancouver having to deal with mentally ill people in Downtown Vancouver. First of all, that’s not something people outside of Vancouver have to deal with. Second, nobody takes Wilkinson seriously to fix that, other than just trying to bitch and whine about the problem. Third, the actual way you do that bit, is “look at these vicious clowns in the NDP, going on and on about tranny rights while crazy people chase down average everyday normal people in Vancouver,” and so on. But Wilkinson can’t even fake populist appeals, because people would simply laugh at him.

Both the Liberals and Greens attacked Horgan continuously over the course of the 32-day campaign, his chief opponents and former allies questioning how the public could trust a "selfish" leader who betrayed his confidence and supply agreement with the Green Party in order to call what they saw as an opportunistic snap election.
Horgan's task was convincing voters the election was undertaken for their benefit, providing them an opportunity to replace a shaky, bygone NDP-Green agreement with a fresh, stable government — regardless of party — that could definitively see them through the rest of the pandemic.
It was ultimately Wilkinson's leadership that was widely criticized for what many saw as a lacklustre response to sexist comments from candidate Jane Thornthwaite toward NDP candidate Bowinn Ma. 
Days later, the leader was under fire again for failing to oust the divisive Chilliwack-Kent candidate Laurie Throness — who compared free contraception to eugenics — from the party roster before it was too late to put forward another candidate.
TDC_ARTICLE_STOP
LOL. The fact that Wilkinson was fucking his own party turned people off him, if anything. You gotta love this type of propaganda, “Wilkinson didn’t do everything we told him, therefore he lost.” It’s so self serving and divorced from reality. For this who don’t know the Laurie Throness story, the cliff notes are that Throness compared an NDP policy offering free contraception to eugenics, yes I know that’s also stupid but that’s not the point, then got cucked hard by Andrew Wilkinson and the rest of the Liberal party. But more importantly, they forced him to resign 14 days before the election. Yes, they forced their own candidate to resign 14 days before the election, and as a result couldn’t field a candidate in the election. If you’re curious, that’s one riding not called yet, but the NDP candidate owns a lead of 5,199 to 5,004 over him. So the Liberals absolutely 100% fucked themselves here.
I already wrote up the Jane Thornthwaite story earlier. It really shows how hilariously unserious the Liberals are about actually winning elections. But it’s important to remember, as I wrote in that Thornthwaite story, this is about them being serious about pleasing their donors. The donors snapped their fingers and wanted Thornthwaite and Throness gone, so they’re gone. And it doesn’t matter that this cost the Liberals at least one seat, they exist to serve their masters.

All three parties were criticized for failing to focus on the opioid crisis and Indigenous relations as key election issues. They were also criticized for a largely white and male slate of candidates.
TDC_ARTICLE_STOP
Throwing a totally valid critique in with an anti-white one. Yeah, these parties don’t focus on the opioid epidemic, because they can’t. The solution is bullets and executions. The solution is fascism. 
And as far as being too white, oh yeah that’s just on the tips of everybodies tongues. Everywhere I walk out, all I can hear is people saying “man, what’s really important is that my candidate be a brown transsexual woman.”

Arguments about the leaders' understanding of racism intensified after both Horgan and Wilkinson were taken to task for their answers during the sole televised debate of the campaign on how they have reckoned with their own privilege as white people. Horgan spoke of playing lacrosse with Indigenous young people and suggested, "I did not see colour," while Wilkinson told a story about working as a doctor and delivering an Indigenous baby who was later named after him.

We should note the assumed and unchallenged anti-white narrative here. The puppets dance on the strings to prove how anti-white they are. I’ve said many times before, this is how it’s done. The donors get one puppet to make an unpopular attack, but then they get their other puppet to defend themselves against such an attack, legitimizing it. 
“White Privilege,” is an anti-white slur, invented by Zionist Jews. At best it can be thought of as a sort of insane conspiracy theory, believed by schizophrenics. Whites are entitled to reparations for years of racial discrimination by universities and coroporations. Whites are entitled to reparations for years of anti-white hate speech by jewish propagandists. 
But this is yet another issue where we can see how the fight is thrown, in this case for white people. The puppet throwing the fight for white people does NOT bring up racial discrimination against white people, nor hate speech against white people. Instead, the puppet makes weak arguments about “not seeing colour,” which are beyond absurd, and easily destroyed. These are idiotic whimpers, that exist only to be slapped down immediately. 
<img src="../Images/puppet.jpg"><figcaption>Artists Illustration of first puppet slapping down second</figcaption>
Remember, cuckservatism is about turning the rage of the people into a weak pinky slap against anti-whitism and sexual perversion. Economic Leftism is about turning the rage of the people against Jeff Bezos and other billionaires into a weak pinky slap, easily beaten down and destroyed.

Mail-in ballots
The precise outcome in close ridings might be uncertain after Saturday night.
More than 720,000 mail-in ballots were requested during the campaign and nearly 498,000 had been returned as of Friday. Vote-by-mail packages are collected centrally and cannot be counted for at least 13 days after general voting day, as per the B.C. Election Act. 
For the nine ridings neck-and-neck by the end of the night, it is too close to call without including the mail-in ballots. For ridings won by a clear majority, it's unlikely the mail-in ballots will change the preliminary results released Saturday.
Officials with Elections BC hope to deliver the final results by Nov. 16, but the date isn't set in stone as it's unclear how much time will be needed to count the mail-in ballots — which are counted by hand, one at a time.
TDC_ARTICLE_STOP
The NDP won, not that you should care. In fact, it’s possible this is a good thing for us, since the NDP is more overtly anti-white (no new white men as candidates as one example), and overtly sexually perverted. They are an easier motivating target. Unfortunately, the next election will be in four years from now, so I think we goys might have to move on to other provinces. I will keep us informed in the meantime.
