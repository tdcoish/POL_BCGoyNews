A father who is fighting in the family courts for the right to speak publicly in opposition to the medical and social gender transition of his child was denied bail in a hearing at Vancouver Supreme Court on Friday.

No goy, there was no actual reason why he could legitimately be denied bail. This is purely a fuck you to him by "justice" Michael Tammen. I'll get to everyone responsible by the end.

The court found him in contempt of previous orders which sought to restrain his speech with regard to the medical and social gender transition of his child by medical and legal authorities. The father opposes this process on the grounds that it is causing irreversible physical and psychological harm to his child.
This process of seeking to defend his child from iatrogenic medical harm—ordinarily something we would associate with positive parenting—has been characterised as "family violence" and harassment by the court and by the child's trans rights activist legal advisers.

On March 16, the father surrendered to the court to be arrested for a hearing on a criminal charge of contempt of court. He was found to be in contempt and remanded to North Fraser Remand prison.
The father's lawyer, Carey Linde, made representations that the father "is not a criminal." Linde said the father is "a working class postman. He is in a labor union." Linde said that, by making this a criminal matter, Attorney General David Eby "is persecuting [the father] plain and simple."

Wow, real shock looking at that face. Surprisingly, I found multiple pictures of his wife and two children, so he appears not to be full on anal-fetishist. It's not surprising the hatred he feels for normal people though, with a face like that.

The father will be remanded on bail until what the court, and the Attorney General for British Columbia, call a "trial" listed for five days starting on April 12, 2021, even though those dates are family—not criminal—proceedings.

Ordinarily, in a family case, such a listing would be referred to as a hearing, and any contempt issues would be treated as a civil—not criminal—matter.
The judge admonished the father for not removing his name from his GoGetFunding page, where he raises money for legal fees. The court found that the GoGetFunding page breached a court order that said that no one must to know who he is.
The judge cautioned him that if the page was not corrected by the April 12, it would count against him. However, the judge then denied a request for the father to have two days release on bail to fix the page, and to alter other sites, from his home computer before he returned to jail.

This is the judge. Her picture is in black and white, because that's far more flattering. I've got a whole deep dive on her I did a while back, and it's not good. She's possibly mentally unstable, an open feminist, and there's really no concern for legitimacy here. She's clearly and obviously abusing what power she's been given, over a literal postal worker, effectively denying him the ability to change his petition while at the same time demanding he do so. 

The solution here does not involve pussies doing the whole "it's so important to not give in and do violence. That's what the STATE wants."

The child's mother apparently caved to pressure to go along with the process, while the father attempted to halt the process, seeking mental health-based alternatives as opposed to drugs.
Although he was ordered by the court not to speak publicly about the medical and legal authorities allowing the gender transition of his child, the father—in desperation—told his story to anyone who would listen to him.
When admonished by the court in a hearing in February 2020, the father said "the reason I do it, or did it, is because I am taking the best interests of my child at heart."

I'm only breaking this up to remind you that we lack the vocabulary to describe this. A man was ordered by Judge Francesca Marzari not to talk about the abuse of his child. She ordered this to protect the child.

Read that sentence again a few times.
TDC_ARTICLE_START
The judge warned the father that further breaches of court orders would likely result in the child's lawyers citing him for contempt. The father made the decision to continue publicly to protest the drugging of his child, with the knowledge that he might lose his liberty, and become a prisoner of conscience, which has now come to pass.
Citizen journalists who helped the father to tell his story to the public were threatened by the child's legal representatives with contempt of court proceedings, and compelled to remove their interviews from online platforms.
Brandon Showalter, reporting in March 2020, wrote that "in court proceedings last week, it emerged that attorneys for the trans-identified teenager were not acting under the direction of their client, according to LifeSite News. The biological female teen has been receiving testosterone injections for the past few months, against the wishes of her father."
The journalist in question, Laura Lynn Thompson, tweeted that it was "an honour to stand against the most insidious assault on our children's identity in the history of our nation."

Laura's a great girl, but she's sort of that useless Boomer Con type. You know the type. Where their instincts are pretty much good, but they've been too addled by propaganda so they just aren't that useful? I hate to be so blunt, but we all know the type.

At least here the source material is so overwhelmingly in our favour there's nothing really to fuck up here. The subject matter IS the criticism. Good job to Laura for doing this, and being brave enough to not take down her video when the court asked. Fuck those people.

Anyway, the article ends there. I will have a new article up tomorrow that goes briefly into detail for all the important people. Why you should care, blurbs about them, relevence to the case, that sort of thing.
