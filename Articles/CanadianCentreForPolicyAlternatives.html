I stumbled upon the "Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives," when I was doing a piece on (((Seth Klein))). That piece, which is going to be multiple pieces, has sprawled out to multiple pieces, because this fucking kike I swear to god, but he has been running the above institution for twenty years, only giving up this title last year. Considering what this Schlomo has been up to, I definitely had to check this out. The story wouldn't be complete without this.

So let me allow the CCPA to explain themselves in their own words.

About the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives
The Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives (CCPA) is an independent, non-partisan research institute concerned with issues of social, economic and environmental justice. Founded in 1980, the CCPA is one of Canada’s leading progressive voices in public policy debates.

The CCPA produces the research and analysis necessary for policymakers, activists, and everyday Canadians to make informed decisions and press for social change. 

We have a National Office in Ottawa, and provincial offices in British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, and Nova Scotia.

Initially you might think "how the hell could these people call themselves 'non-partisan'?" Well goy, they lobby all political parties, and corporate institutions, and academic institutions. They lobby them all, and they all work with them. So when they tell you that they don't have political party affiliation, which is what "non-partisan" means, they're not lying.

If they tell you that they're non-partisan, and try to get that to mean "just looking out for all Canadians," well then...

Going to have to call bullshit on their "majority of Canadians," line. These people are the Privileged Class, almost by definition. After all, I never met a trucker who worked at an NGO. 

Anyway, I took a look at their flagship product, the "Alternative Federal Budget." Here's an except from their part on "Canada and the International Decade for People of African Descent."

It's basically exactly what you'd expect. "Do more racial discrimination against White People, signed Schlomo Noseblatt." This is something you should be paying extremely close attention to, because this is the actually effective anti-Whiteness that you'll get from jews. You'll notice that there is no direct racial attacks on White People, and in fact, reading through the entire document, they don't even mention White People one single time. 

The actual policy goals of these Schlomos, Sethy Klein especially, is to do racial discrimination against White People. That's it. But the propaganda here gives lots of room for plausible deniability. This is far worse than some retarded negress online doing the "all Whyte Peepol be raceeysst and shieeet. paypal me cracka!"

For the record, they also have a "Racial Equality," part. In that little 4 page document, they also do not mention White People one time. Of course, here it's a little bit more ridiculous, since everybody knows that White People are the ones actually suffering from Racial Discrimination, but they do not at any point explicitly attack White People.

Balanced debate
CCPA research doesn’t just sit on a shelf gathering dust. Every month, we are featured in hundreds of media stories. We work proactively to balance media coverage of issues like the economy, poverty, the growing gap between the rich and the rest of us, climate change, health care, education, and much more.

Our experts are in high demand as media commentators, promoting solutions that unite, rather than divide, Canadians. Both politicians and policy makers turn to CCPA research when they need credible non-partisan analysis.

They're highly sought after by the CBC, CTV, Global News, The Star, all these mouthpiece organizations that real Canadians hate. Meanwhile, my little twitter account <a href="../Articles/CensoredFromTwatter.html">got banned</a>. Pretty hilarious in the age of Social Media the very idea that you would need some exclusive organization that nobodies ever heard of before to find out what the people want. I guess that's why they need massive censorship online. Because how else could you find out what the people want if you don't censor them, or something.

Myth-busting
The CCPA debunks myths—like the myth that an aging population threatens public health care, or that meeting our climate change obligations is a job-killer. Our bi-monthly magazine, The Monitor, is packed with facts and analysis that will help you untangle the spin.

Solutions
We don’t just analyze problems. We work on solutions—solutions that show Canadians’ best values are not only possible, they’re practical. These ideas are anchored by some basic principles: human dignity and freedom, fairness, equality, environmental sustainability, and the public good. They show that we can afford to build a more just and sustainable Canada—and that our economy will be stronger for it.

You don't really need me to analyze this for you. These are tedious nothings. They support wars based on lies. They support massive corporate-state censorship. They support child trannies. They support racial discrimination against Whites. They support billionaires stealing ever more of the nations wealth. But something something "climate emergency," something something "human dignity."
