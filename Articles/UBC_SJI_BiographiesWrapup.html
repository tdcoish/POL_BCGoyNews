Well goyim, I started documenting the biographies of the faculty in the insane asylum known as the UBC "Social Justice Institute." I did this partly because using the insane shit they say should be politically useful, but also just for shits and gigs. Of the 20 faculty members with a bio page, I selected the best 6, and have the results here. Those selected were, <a href="../Articles/UBC_SJI_DinaAlKassim.html">Dina Al-Kassim</a>, <a href="../Articles/UBC_SJI_BeckiRoss.html">Becki "Insane Lez" Ross</a>, <a href="UBC_SJI_JohnPaulCatungal.html">John Paul "Cock now" Catungal</a>, <a href="UBC_SJI_MinelleMahtani.html">Minelle "Fuck Whitey" Mahtani</a>, <a href="UBC_SJI_ChrisPatterson.html">Chris "gayface" Patterson</a>, and finally <a href="UBC_SJI_JaniceStewart.html">Janice "Most Boring Person Alive" Stewart</a>. Each of them provided us with laughs and a little revulsion, and one of the most useful things that they brought us was a collection of quotes or other insanity.

In no particular order, here are some great tidbits.
1) "Sexuality and aesthetics in transnational modernist and contemporary postcolonial cultures."
2) "Examines parrhesia and the politics of address in the practice of literary ranting."

3) "Studies contemporary butch/femme relations."
4) "Creates queer spaces on campuses."
<img src="../Images/laughCheetah.png">
5) "bi-racial South Asian women's heterosexuality"
6) "inter-racial white/Asian gay male relationships"
<img src="../Images/laughGoodfellas.jpg">
7) "queer courtship and marriage in Vancouver."
8) "Expelled: The Neo-Colonial Rule of Unruly Sexual Subjects in Vancouver, 1975-1985"
9) "interdisciplinary scholar trained in the nexus of critical human geography and intersectional feminist theorizing."
<img src="../Images/laughingNHLPlayer.png">
10) "Filipinx and Asian Canadian studies"
11) "queer of colour critique"
<img src="../Images/laughingSupermodels.jpg">
12) "an anal history of HIV/AIDS" (just kidding, he said oral)
13) "anti-travel novel"
14) "queer speculative novel"
<img src="../Images/laughMadMen.jpg">
15) "He sees video games as an artistic expression of global empire by playing them erotically and as Asiatic commodities."
16) meta study of "Southeast Asian Diasporic novels focusing on queer migrants."
<img src="../Images/laughPepe1.jpg">
17) Editor in chief of "decomp journal,"
18) "Feminist analyses of terrorism"
<img src="../Images/meme_laughSamHyde.png">

Those are the soundbites. The purpose of the above is for you to be able to just chuckle if you ever get into a debate with some Destiny type, who tried to "muh academia," you. You just respond with "LMAO, Queer of Colour Theorizing".
<img src="../Images/laughAdolf.jpg">
For the record, "feminist analyses of terrorism," might actually be the funniest, and it's from one <a href="https://grsj.arts.ubc.ca/person/jessi-taylor/">Jessi "Queer Feminist" Taylor</a> who I didn't cover because she was mostly redundant. And once again, you use it the same way. "Hey goys, you know what we need, some feminist analyses of terrorism."

If you need something more in depth, hopefully the rest of this list will help you, but for 99% of the audience, this is all you need.

However, I did want to do my own little study on the UBC "Social Justice Institute." First, of the 20 faculty, how many are White? Just 7. How many are men? Just 3, and two of them are openly anal-fetishists. So there is a grand total of one potentially straight White Man, and he's doing the "muh indigenous rights," bit. 

And I didn't even get into the outright insanity of the Chris Patterson faggot, who openly writes under a pen name of "Kawika Guillermo," writer of a self-described "anti-travel novel," and "queer speculative novel". That didn't even make the cut, because it wasn't strictly academic work. It's just what these people get up to in their spare time.

Long story short: the faculty is exactly what you expected.
