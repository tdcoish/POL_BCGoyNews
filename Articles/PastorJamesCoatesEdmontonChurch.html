TDC_ARTICLE_START
EDMONTON: The Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedoms today announced that the trial of Pastor James Coates, of GraceLife Church, will proceed on May 3, 2021 at 9:30 AM in Provincial Court in Edmonton, in courtroom 514 of the Edmonton Law Courts.

The trial will proceed for up to four days initially, but will then be adjourned because government lawyers are not yet prepared to present any medical or scientific evidence that might support the health orders under which Pastor Coates is charged. Pastor Coates’ Charter challenge to the constitutionality and legality of Dr. Deena Hinshaw’s lockdown restrictions will be heard by the Court at an unknown later date.

The backstory. Pastor James Coates, of Grace Life Church in Edmonton, Alberta, was charged with a violation of some bullshit Alberta "Lockdown," regulation. Specifically, having slightly too many people on the premises. As a result, the Conservative Party of Alberta, through their bureaucracy, wanted to make an example of this little goy-peasant. So they threw Pastore James Coates in jail, and put him in solitary confinement. There was literally no reason to do this, he's not a career criminal, but it's fun to torture the little people.

As said by the JCCF, the lawyers for the Albertan Government don't actually have any plan for explaining any sort of scientific or medical rationale for the utterly arbitrary "lockdown" orders, but they're having the trial anyway.
TDC_ARTICLE_START
Earlier this afternoon, Judge Robert Shaigec decided that up to 1,000 people will be permitted to attend the trial virtually through the court’s virtual software. However, the Court has decided that those people will only be able to hear the trial, and not be able to watch it. There will be no video feed. The Judge’s Decision follows a request by the government prosecution lawyer that the trial not be viewable virtually. The prosecution lawyer did not want any images or video stream of her to be viewable during the trial. The Court additionally granted the prosecutor’s request that her name not be used during the trial.

Not mad. I couldn't find a picture of Judge Bobby Shaigec, so maybe just imagine some cunt. Actually, here's a picture of Judge Michael Tammen, so imagine his face as Shaigec's. 
<img src="../Images/justiceMichaelTammen2.jpg">
There is absolutely no valid reason that we the public cannot learn the name of this malicious prosecutor, nor see her cunt face. Absolutely no reason at all, other than they fear the people they are oppressing. There is also no reason to limit the number of virtual watchers to 1,000. That's just arbitrary, and designed to hide from the people.

This is why you need to have a public strategy of shaming and more, to force these judges to stop doing shit like this. It's just like the <a href="../Articles/RobHooglandTrialEvent.html">"He Who Must Not Be Named" trial</a>, where pro-Pervert judges ruled that it would harm a child being abused... if the father published any information about the abuse in order to stop the abuse.
TDC_ARTICLE_START
Although the Justice Centre is pleased that up to 1,000 people will be able to listen to the trial, it is our position that restricting video access to the trial goes against the open court principle and removes the Crown Prosecutor from public accountability.
TDC_ARTICLE_STOP
Yeah, what he said.
TDC_ARTICLE_START
“The Charter requires Canada’s federal and provincial governments to support and justify restrictions on Charter freedoms whether a court challenge to those restrictions exists or not. The inability or unwillingness of the Alberta government to present medical and scientific evidence at this May 3 trial suggests that lockdown restrictions since March of 2020 are based purely on speculation, not science. If these measures were based on evidence, the government would be able to produce that evidence in court, after almost 14 months of lockdown restrictions,” concludes Carpay.

I skipped ahead to the good part. Basically, John Carpay, Coates lawyer, is making at least something of the correct argument. Instead of the pathetic and annoying "muh freedoms," argument, pointing out the arbitrariness of these rulings is far superior. Both in a legal sense, since the government does have the right to impose itself for a validly argued greater good, but also in the political sense. 

I'm fucking sick and tired of q-tier retards arguing on principles and not specifics. Billionaires in the US have added 1.1 trillion to their net wealth during COVID 19. Have you gotten wealthier? But no, instead of the easy to make "this shit's all fake, it's designed to transfer your wealth into billionaire pockets," weirdo faggots want to talk about "muh sovereign citizen," LOLbertarian garbage. Shut the fuck up.

Anyway, this case is ongoing now, and the JCCF has made their first update.

TDC_ARTICLE_START
The Crown prosecutor has sought and obtained a Court Order to withhold video-taping of the Court proceedings of the Alberta Government vs Pastor James Coates from the public, and to anonymize the name of the Crown Prosecutor. The Crown called its only witness, Janine Hanrahan, the Alberta Health Services (AHS) bureaucrat who inspected the church over many Sundays from November 2020 through to February 2021. Ms. Hanrahan told the Court she saw sanitization supplies, and congregants who did not wear masks. She said people in the Church were videotaping the RCMP on December 13, when they came with her to the Church during service. The AHS inspector reported she saw people talking to each other in the lobby.

Ms Hanrahan stated she went to the church balcony to count how many people were in the sanctuary, and video-recorded church members singing in worship. She further testified that Grace Life Elders told her and the RCMP it is an offence under the Criminal Code to disrupt a church service.

Lawyer Leighton Grey represents Pastor Coates and Grace Life Church, and cross-examined Ms. Hanrahan, asking the AHS bureaucrat why she took RCMP officers with her to the church. Notes from an RCMP officer indicate that Ms. Hanrahan told police that she feared being harmed by going to the church, but admitted on the stand that she did not have concerns that someone from church would harm her. Ms. Hanrahan then said that bringing the RCMP was because of media attention.

So this Hanrahan cunt does the typical "I'm so afraid of these people I'm oppressing," routine, before admitting that she's a liar on stand. Good start by lawyer Leighton Grey. I guess the other lawyer, Carpay, is not doing the live proceedings. It seems like the first day went quite well. 
TDC_ARTICLE_START
Grey: you’ve described some of these activities as risky (people singing re: asymptomatic spread of covid-19). Were you told by your employers (AHS) that singing was a risky behavior?

Ms. Hanrahan: yes

Mr. Grey: You took that as face value?

Ms. Hanrahan: the science made sense to me

Mr. Grey: you said something odd in your notes. You said clapping/cheering for RCMP at GL could lead to covid spread.

Ms. Hanrahan: yes

Mr. Grey: did AHS tell you that?

Ms. Hanrahan: no

Mr. Grey: so that’s your own theory?

Ms. Hanrahan: yes

Mr. Grey: did you read that in any studies?

Ms. Hanrahan: no

Wow. It sure would be nice to, you know, actually be able to see the injustice going on here. Still, the transcript is at least something.
TDC_ARTICLE_START
It was expected the Crown would call at least one RCMP officer, but none were called.

The Crown then made an Application to prevent the Justice Centre lawyers from calling evidence for the purposes of demonstrating that the government had violated six different Charter rights and freedoms. The Crown said three of these were hopeless, and that we should not be permitted to call evidence in support of the defence position that the Charter had been violated.

Judge Robert Shaigec ruled against the Crown, saying that it has to be very clear that no Charter right breach could possibly be found, and that the rule is to permit evidence and argument regarding alleged Charter breaches. He completely denied the Crown’s application, saying all of Pastor Coates’ alleged Charter rights violation arguments are fair game, and the defence can present evidence of them.
TDC_ARTICLE_STOP
It was pretty shocking that they even tried to pull that shit.
TDC_ARTICLE_START
Crown counsel then cross-examined Pastor Coates, who demonstrated impressive knowledge of facts and science in relation to Covid and lockdowns. At the end of the court hearing, the Crown opposed the Justice Centre application to enter the transcript of the 16 February bail hearing that led to Pastor’s detention. The basis for her objections were irrelevance, and the fact that she was the Crown who sought to remand Pastor.  This point will be argued fully tomorrow, but Judge Shaigec made it somewhat clear that he is inclined to admit the transcript unless she can persuade him not to do so.

James Coates seems like no joke, which I was afraid of. I've been burned by FinkleCovid before, but he seems sharp and on the point. I'll keep you informed.
