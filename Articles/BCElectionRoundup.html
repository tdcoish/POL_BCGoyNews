Here is the start of an overview of the BC Provincial Election, going into the weeds a little bit, but only to provide an overview. The point is to help those somewhat naive understand what’s going on, and to understand the actions of the parties and the propagandists all as one unified system. I will be including snippets from most articles linked.
For those unfamiliar to BC Politics. NDP = New Democrat Party = Donor-Left Party. Liberal Party = Donor-Center Party.
First off we have news at the very end of October that the NDP was going to hold a surprise election.

Just in case anyone thought I was making the whole "it is illegal to congregate in public" thing, political parties are not allowed to campaign, except on heavily censored social media “platforms”. This is a straight up stolen election, done so that the party most in tune with Globo Homo can steal power from the people to an even larger extent than they currently do.

We needed to get our own political party up and running months ago, but I thought I had literally an entire year longer. Regardless, every day counts now, and this is such a sham election, that it opens up quite a lot of opportunity for delegitimizing this system.

I mostly stand by this analysis. This entire election being moved forwards one year was a completely cynical ploy by the Left-Donor Party in order to grab more power. There was absolutely no justification for this on the side of the people.

Moving forwards we have a quick article I wrote halfway through November, when I found out that the NDP had a policy of reserving new seats for essentially brown people, women, or trannys/homos, but definitely not normal white men.

More importantly, I’m actually not as outraged as you might think, because politicians are nothing more than shills for their donors. It doesn’t matter who’s standing behind the counter at the bank, only who runs the head office, and it doesn’t matter who these politicians are, they are selected for obedience.

Still, it is nice to see these people go mask off, and as always, getting this written down is great, as it is something we need to be referring back to when they talk about “bigotry,” and “exclusion,” since they literally have a political party that racially discriminates against whites and sexually discriminates against men. Also, discriminates based on not having a weird sexual fetish.

Here’s an article I wrote around the same time, showing how utterly donor-controlled the entire fight is, right from the start, with the Donor-Center parties big promise being getting rid of the sales tax… for one year only.

So yeah, LOL at anyone invested in this donor fight, where apparently the hot button issues that face us are slight changes to the tax code. Young people having McJobs that pay minimum wage at age 30, or not having jobs at all? Nah, not an issue. An HIV positive Anal-Fetishist diagnosing orphaned 2 year old children as having “gender dysphoria,”? Nah, not an issue. Massive anti-white racial discrimination in university admissions, and elsewhere? Nah, not an issue. What’s really important is slight changes to the tax code, goy.

Another article here about the propagandists trying desperately to get you excited for an 18 year old girl who is running on the exact same policies as Michael Bloomberg.

Heeyyyyyyyyy kiidddddssssssssss. Do you know what’s cool? Supporting Global Warming Catastrophism is cool! Focusing on better mental health care in a really vague way is COOL! Focusing on “the affordability crisis,” without mentioning migration, or being too negative on those rich oppressed capitalists IS COOL! Separating pre-schoolers from their parents is KEWL! You should be Kewl like Kate O’Connor.

You know what’s not Kewl? Making lists of the war propagandists who lied us into Iraq or Afghanistan. You know what’s not Kewl? Putting an end to racial discrimination against white people. You know what’s not cool? Pointing out that zionist jews have made it illegal for the goyim to fact check their fake lampshade-o-caust, while denying actual genocides they have committed. You know what’s not cool? Advocating for working class people who have their jobs and livelihoods destroyed by mass migration, outsourcing, or financial speculation is VERY MUCH NOT COOL. Radical Kate O’ Connor, mega-cool girl is not a fan of any of those things.

It’s a great way to understand how utterly divorced from any real populist movement we had going on here. Probably if you only look at one article you should click on that one, because there is a certain point where you realize how idiotic you are for getting involved in the Donor Fight known as mainstream politics.

Next we have a great example of the coordination between the propagandists and the parties. The absolute fakest and gayest of non-troversies was raised at a Donor-Center party candidate for making incredibly tepid accusations that a different parties female candidate was good looking. I am not exaggerating at all. 
<a href="../Articles/BCLiberalsCuckOwnCandidate.html">BC Liberals Cuck Own Candidate: </a>

Oh dear god. After an online roast, watched by pretty much nobody BTW, some slightly sexual comments were made. At a roast. A fucking roast. “They were hurtful words, they were sexist and inappropriate.”

Imagine this being the level of political discourse in a serious country. I mean fucking imagine. It’s difficult for me to commentate on this, because I am genuinely thunderstruck.

But then imagine apologizing. I think a lot of people, especially young people, have come around to understanding that you never apologize to these propagandists. If they ask for an apology, tell them to go fuck themselves. However, you do need to understand that these politicians are already whores. Behind the scenes, their employers are demanding that they apologize, so they apologize. It doesn’t matter if it causes them to lose elections or votes, because they don’t exist to win elections. They exist to service the people who write their cheques, and those people demanded an apology for a non-issue.

For the record, I watched the “roast,” in question, and it was just a painfully unfunny collection of shills attempting to pretend like they have charisma. I am offended by how low IQ and low energy the entire event was. It’s a fucking roast. But then again, you can’t say anything funny, because funniness is transgressive. Calling out these people for being worthless, obedient servants of the privileged and powerful might be funny, but it’s just not going to happen.

Ultimately it’s important to understand that this is a “work”, as they say in pro-wrestling. This woman wasn’t wanted by those inside the party, so they came up with the excuse of “well the propagandists (that every peasant hates) don’t like her so we have to excuse her for optics reasons.” Nothing would be more popular than telling the media to go fuck themselves, but part of the work is that you pretend the media has more power than they actually do.

The next article is from the CBC Propagandists celebrating three brown people running for office. And not just brown people, but anti-white brown people. It’s really just more anti-white propaganda. What is important to note, is that the Donor-Left does this anti-whitism, but then the Donor-Center, or Donor-Right wherever you live, will absolutely refuse to fight back, and will throw the fight. Let me explain from the article.
<a href="../Articles/ThreeBrownPeopleRunningForOffice.html">Important: Three Brown People Running for Office: </a>

See, this is exactly the point at which the Cuckservative would, in response to this anti-whitism, say something like “well I also believe in equality and true colourblindness and blah blah.” Then the anti-white would respond with “you don’t know the struggle that coloured of peopleness like myself has been lived experiences blah blah.” And the cuckservative would then shut up and be owned.

Instead, I’ll just call this racial discrimination against white people, and make sure that everyone in his riding knows that a vote for him is a vote to hurt white people. The unfortunate part, and why Donor-Rightism really exists, is because those people are paid very handsomely to throw the fight.

<a href="../Articles/AndrewWilkinsonBigFag.html">Here’s </a>another article where I just laugh at how lame the Donor-Center candidate is. It's not really worth quoting, it's mostly pictures.

Finally here’s the article I wrote after the Donor-Left won. 
<a href="../Articles/NDPWinsElection.html">Donor-Left Wins Election: </a>

The NDP won, not that you should care. In fact, it’s possible this is a good thing for us, since the NDP is more overtly anti-white (no new white men as candidates as one example), and overtly sexually perverted. They are an easier motivating target. Unfortunately, the next election will be in four years from now, so I think we goys might have to move on to other provinces. I will keep us informed in the meantime.

So, ultimately, what’s the point? Well I think this wrapup is actually better for those outside of BC. Sometimes it’s easier to see just how utterly fake and controlled the Donor Fight really is. It can be extremely easy to become invested in Donor-Right or Donor-Left puppet, but understand that their donors are your enemy, and they will happily throw the fight every single time on every single issue that you care about. Understand that the propaganda has very little power, but they happily work with them under the guise of being attacked in order to further the goals of their donors, while providing a weak excuse to their voters.

Ultimately just understand that Donor-Politics isn’t for you. There is nothing and no one here advocating for you, and the Donors for both parties are highly overlapping. That’s why extremely hot button issues such as racial discrimination against white people, sexual abuse of literally orphaned children, massively increasing wealth disparity between billionaires and everyone else, foreign population in universities, etcetera, aren’t even discussed. They aren’t even on the table, because ultimately the policies of both Donor Parties would be exactly the same. 

The solution is hard, but I stress it constantly, we need to make our own parties. This will also allow us space to do other activism, both because of the organization, as well as the fact that any injustice done to us will help us electorally, making them less likely to do outright injustices to us in the first place. 

To any Americans reading this, please take a look at nationaljusticeparty.com, for a good example of what we need to be doing moving forwards.

Thanks for reading.
