<a href="../Articles/ChristinaClarkCanDocumentaries.html">I recently wrote about Anti-Whitism in CBC funding decisions, through the perspective of Canadian Documentary Filmmaker Christina Clark.</a> She talked about a "CBC Creative Relief Fund," so I decided to look it up.

RECIPIENTS OF THE CBC CREATIVE RELIEF FUND
119 original Canadian projects have been selected to receive immediate support through THE CBC CREATIVE RELIEF FUND, exceeding the initial commitment with $2.2 million in development and production funding confirmed across three programming streams. With close to 9000 submissions received, 99 projects have been selected for development funding and 20 for production funding, including 51 projects (43 per cent) from self-identified Black, Indigenous and People of Colour (BIPOC) creators.

“Thank you to the thousands of Canadian creators who submitted their ideas to the CBC Creative Relief Fund, including new storytellers we have now been introduced to. We were overwhelmed by the response and the creativity of projects, which made for some very difficult decisions,” said Barbara Williams, Executive Vice-President, CBC. “The world has continued to evolve rapidly since the Fund was launched, and we are proud to champion these unique voices and stories that reflect our country and the extraordinary times we are living in. The innovative projects we have selected offer a diverse range of inspiring and entertaining perspectives from creators across Canada, and will help support the recovery and resurgence of our artistic and creative communities.”

Pretty amazing how White People are 67% of this country, yet the Anti-White CBC brags about having a disproportionate number of non-whites being given our tax dollars to make shitty media. However, below this they link to the projects that got approved. Most are boring, but I was surprised that they appeared to be far shittier than they were Anti-White. The Racial Discrimination appears to be done at the entry point, but I didn't see anything too Anti-White. What I saw instead was shit like this in the "Playwright Pilot Stream."

Martin Kinch & Bill Dow
Vancouver, B.C. 
Jack Abbott was a star reporter; now he’s confined to a wheelchair and running The Drive, a down-at-heels little community newspaper.

I wrote that up in less than a minute, and I'm pretty sure that I could do a serious proposal that's better than all the above losers in about 10 minutes.

These people are clowns.

I tell you it was pure pain reading through these kindergarten level pitches that they included in the documents. The sheer tedium of these people. Not just the poetry, these people absolutely suck at everything and need to be doing manual labour or something. So they suck and are HIV-Positive.
