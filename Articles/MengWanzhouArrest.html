There has been an update on the Meng Wanzhou case yesterday, and I realized that I need to explain the backstory for those who don't know. Meng Wanzhou is a Chinese business executive with permanent residency here in Canada. She has that residency because she purchased our Real Estate, which qualifies as "investment," in Canada, which therefore automatically gives her citizenship. Yes, that statement is insane, but that's not the point of this article.

TDC_ARTICLE_START
VANCOUVER -- On the morning of Dec. 1, 2018, Meng Wanzhou, the Chief Financial Officer of Chinese telecom giant Huawei and the daughter of its founder, touched down in Vancouver.

Meng planned to visit one of her two Vancouver homes to drop off some boxes, then catch an evening flight to Mexico City.

Eventually, she planned to continue on a trip that would take her to Costa Rica and the G20 in Argentina, with a stop in Paris on the way home.

Instead, as she stood up from her business class seat onboard the Cathay Pacific 777, and stepped into the glass jetway, she was approached by two Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) officers.

She was arrested here in Vancouver International Airport on December 1st, 2018 by the RCMP. The charges laid on her were "Fraud, and conspiracy to commit fraud in order to circumvent U.S. sanctions against Iran." 

Of course, US sanctions against Iran are complete and utter Zionist bullshit. Iran stands in the way of the Zionist goal of Greater Israel. Zionists want to destroy Iran and the Iranian People, because they feel they stand in the way of this goal. Since US Politicians, as well as ours, are for sale to the highest bidder, Zionists such as Sheldon Adelson, Michael Bloomberg, and many others, purchase them for these purposes.

On top of this, her charges are transparent bullshit, and obvious thuggery, as the recent updates have made even clearer. Meng Wanzhou was clearly and obviously arrested for political reasons, in order to send a message to China, and any serious politician would immediately have her released. You will see a lot of bullshit about "oh she was just on a routine checkup blah blah," but this was a clear and obvious pre-meditated power move.

There are other players involved as well, mostly MAGA, Microsoft, Apple, Google, Amazon, although I use them as a standin for Tech Companies more broadly. Huwaii makes good phones, and any and all excuses to have them removed from the market will be jumped on. This also serves the purpose of our governments, since Huwaii would be very unlikely to spy on us for the benefit of the FBI, or other police agencies, while MAGA have shown a strong willingness to work with these agencies without question.

So this is basically the shot. This is our government, on behalf of Zionist Jews who hate all the goyim, and Tech Conglomerates who look down on the filthy peasants, arresting an important Chinese Official. And yes, you, the Canadian Goy-Peasant, get absolutely zero benefit out of this. And no, the government will still happily send your job over seas, including to China. And yes, this very same government will happily import Chinese People into your neighbourhood and then lecture you on your "xenophobia." And no, this government won't do anything about the massive censorship these Conglomerates do to us despite using the government infrastructure that we built. And yes, these Conglomerates will happily hire legions of foreigners over a single native born White Canadian/American.

Since December 1st, 2018, her trial has started, and the details that have come out are entirely bad for the Donor Class, but that's what I'll be writing about in different articles.
